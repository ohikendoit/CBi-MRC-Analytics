corporate responsibility report which is prepared in accordance with global reporting initiative g4 core level and is available in full at www. newgold. com. g4 guides us to identify and report on material topics those issues which are of greatest interest and importance to our business and to our communities of interest. while this summary provides an overview of these topics and our performance in 2014 the full report provides more details information and stories associated with the identified priorities. this summary includes the assets illustrated in the map of our properties with the exception of the el morro project which is managed by our partner goldcorp inc. a compilation of data across all sites is presented except when noted otherwise. all currency is in united states dollars unless otherwise noted. native vegetation preserved at the cerro san pedro mine. 2 this year we chose a theme that reflects our way of doing business living the new gold values. one of those core values is integrity it is about doing the right thing. operating mines responsibly is not only the right thing to do ethically speaking it is frankly the only way to do business successfully. at new gold we are committed to continuous improvement we know that we can always do better. our internal standards are based on best practices and international standards and we regularly set goals and measure performance to ensure we are continuously improving. in 2014 we met our production targets and completed implementation of our environmental and community engagement and development standards. cerro san pedro became certified to the international cyanide management code and new a on became the first mine in north america certified to iso 50001 energy management. we work to keep our people healthy and safe employee development is also a new gold core value. our people are key to our success and we continue to focus on leadership development and building capacity from within our organization. we are committed to keeping our people injury free but 2014 presented a few challenges. despite exceeding industry wide health and safety performance standards we did not meet all of our internal targets based on our 2013 performance. to ensure that this trend is reversed we have spent time to understand the causes and have undertaken several actions to improve these results. we are an active part of the communities where we operate at new gold we focus on being an engine for sustainable economic development and an active contributor to the well being of our host communities. later this year cerro san pedro will initiate its first phase of closure. we have engaged our employees and the local communities in planning for closure and have listened to their aspirations and concerns so that these can be considered in an integrated closure plan. we will continue to do so throughout the closure process. these discussions have already led to training programs for our employees as well as capacity and entrepreneurial development projects within the local communities. we expect this e ort will support a successful transition to a sustainable post closure community and resilient economy. we work to protect the environment we continue to look for opportunities to reduce our impact on the ecosystems within which we operate. our management standards are guided by internationally recognized standards including iso 14001 the international cyanide management code and the mining association of canada s towards sustainable mining initiative. we have achieved all of our environmental targets this year however one notable incident occurred at cerro san pedro involving a release of process material from the site. there were no permanent impacts to the environment and the necessary actions were implemented. these included immediate reporting to the regulatory agencies and directly alerting local communities. important lessons were learned which will reduce the possibility of a similar recurrence and improve our systems not only at cerro san pedro but also at our other operations. looking ahead 2014 was a year of consolidating our corporate culture of safety respect for our communities and environmental responsibility. 2015 promises to be a pivotal year for new gold. we are continuing to plan for expansion at new a on and rainy river has started construction early this year. everyone at every operation development and exploration site and corporate o ice has contributed to these e orts and i extend my gratitude to the people of new gold. i look forward to continually improving our standards systems and performance in the years to come. robert gallagher president and chief executive o icer message

free a er each workday and we strive to create a culture that motivates individuals to keep themselves and their colleagues healthy and safe. in 2014 the mesquite mine and blackwater project achieved two years without a lost time incident while the rainy river project achieved one year without a lost time incident. the cerro san pedro mine also achieved outstanding results with two million man hours worked without a lost time incident. despite these accomplishments new gold faced some challenges in 2014 and as a result did not meet internal targets for injury frequency reduction. there were fewer incidents in 2014 however we also had fewer working hours relative to 2013 resulting in a somewhat higher injury frequency rate. while our internal targets were not met our injury frequency rates were 16 lower than comparable industry benchmarks. with a stronger focus on employee safety behaviours risk assessments and increased interactions and observations by supervisors we believe that we will see positive results in the near future. in accordance with our health and safety system assessments were conducted at all operations in 2014 using a combination of internal peer review third party audits and or audits by regulators. the resulting recommendations are being implemented with a particular focus on new structures and processes to enhance the performance of the joint occupational health and safety committees across the organization. injury frequency rates 1new gold joint occupational health and safety committees are a key part of health and safety systems and help

blackwater is located in a heavily forested area and is prone to forest fires. the 2014 fire season was particularly severe. blackwater was pleased to be able to support the firefighting e orts by o ering access to operational camp services. providing firefighters helicopter pilots and engineers with the use of camp facilities gave them much needed support during their arduous and dangerous e orts. in addition it allowed us to test our emergency response procedures working alongside the government agencies. coming to a place like this really helps to get some good nourishment and rest to get ready. anthony vandenborn centennial unit firefighter we were pleased to provide immediate and ongoing camp services to wildfire crews. new gold supports and thanks the teams for the good work they did to help our local region and the province. tim bekhuys director of environment and sustainability blackwater project new gold canadian operations received the 2014 top safety cultures tm

operate. so we make sure that we understand the impacts of our operations on local communities. then we use that understanding to guide our actions to become a catalyst for improved quality of life and to contribute to sustainable development. engaging with our host communities we foster open two way communications with residents and community leaders from a project s earliest development phase through the mine s life and through closure. we believe that the social aspects of operations are really based on dialogue with the surrounding communities it is important to thoroughly understand the people their needs and concerns so that we can truly engage and contribute to long term social cultural and economic development. new gold community engagement and development standards guide us to identify our communities of interest e ectively engage and sustain dialogue and report on performance. they also drive us to constantly improve our processes and our performance. in 2014 all new gold sites hosted regular engagement activities remaining connected to host communities to understand their priorities and to identify issues as they arise. all of our sites maintained feedback mechanisms with the exception of rainy river where a formal feedback mechanism is currently under development. 7we foster open two way communications with residents and community leaders from a project s earliest development phase through the mine s life and through closure. cerro de san pedro resident and employee. being a part of our communities cerro de san pedro youth. 8 8social impact assessment of peak mines roster change peak mines has been operating with its underground miners on a 4 days on 4 days o schedule. to simplify and enhance operations management decided to evaluate a 7 days on 7 days o schedule. but what would be the e ects on the workforce their families and their contribution to the businesses and services of the cobar community peak mines is a major employer in town and the potential for negative direct or indirect impacts needed to be considered. rather than push through with a decision based solely on operational needs peak initiated a social impact assessment sia using a third party consultant to provide an in depth consultation process that included drilling down into all potential ramifications to test both positive and negative assumptions. the outcome would allow for informed decisions to be made to ensure that negative impacts for the workforce and the community are minimized and the positive aspects are maximized. a key driver for undertaking the sia is to better understand how the proposed change might impact the workforce their families and the broader cobar community. we invested in finding out the real possible outcomes from the roster change and have put controls in place to monitor and manage the negative aspects. chris higgins peak mines environment and social responsibility superintendent a sampling of employees was consulted as were businesses and other targeted external parties. the study concluded that there would be some e ect on population with some families expected to leave cobar. this allowed management to put in place mitigations such as providing incentives for residential employees. regarding e ects on local business there was a likelihood of a negative impact but this would be mitigated by providing funds to entrepreneurship programs and ensuring rigorous local procurement policies. it also suggested that safety would be an issue with the longer work week and employees opting to leave cobar during the week o. again management could respond with actions to alleviate this risk. the results of the study were then shared with the wider cobar community to ensure that residents understood that while some e ects could be expected new gold would be working to mitigate these impacts. the high level of consultation internally and externally shows our integrity to do what is right. greg bowkett general

of cerro de san pedro have formed a grassroots organization desarrollo san pedro with the aim of promoting entrepreneurship within the local economy. one of its first accomplishments was a local product fair held in november 2014. the main goal of the fair was to support local economic growth by commercializing products and services produced by residents of the municipality. the event was seen as an opportunity to open marketing channels between clients producers and traders. the fair was a great success with 50 exhibitors from nine communities and attendance by approximately 4 000 people. among the products and services on o er were live music tourism services handicra s silver jewelry hand woven fabrics cacti souvenirs local produce and traditional foods and pastries including regional sweets and preserves. the fair helped the public know what we are doing in cerro de san pedro and also activated the economy of the municipality. alejandra segura resident of portezuelo and fair exhibitor contributing to sustainable communities sustainable mining to us means that communities around our mines should be better o a er mine closure because the mine created long term benefits during its operating lifetime. our commitment to local socio economic sustainability is demonstrated in the opportunities we create for local employment and local suppliers the investments we make in community infrastructure scholarships and adult education initiatives through fostering local entrepreneurship programs and in capacity building and economic diversification projects. we believe these are powerful tools for creating direct and indirect socio economic benefits for local communities. in 2014 our sites collectively spent 176 million in employee wages and benefits. we also invested almost 5 million in our host communities a 33 increase from 2013 and the most we have invested in the last three years. being a part of our communities vendor at first local product fair at cerro de san pedro. 10 supporting our local economy mesquite and local small business development in 2014 the mesquite mine partnered with the imperial valley small business development center ivsbdc to assist small businesses hit hard by the recession and the recent closure of one of its largest employers. ivsbdc is a non profit supported by the u. s. small business administration local cities and corporate contributions. with funding from mesquite ivsbdc advisors worked with local businesses to help them expand increase services build capacity diversify product lines and streamline processes. roo hide saddlery llc a 26 year old firm producing high end horse saddles was one of the businesses participating in the program. with new gold s support roo hide was able to expand its manufacturing processes and streamline production to improve e iciency. mesquite s contribution provided tangible help to enhance business and job growth in a region facing economic struggles. the program mesquite supported allowed us to provide services at no cost to small businesses to help them develop the skills they need to survive and thrive in a challenging economy. the ultimate goal is to contribute to the economic stability and growth of the region. carlos figari ivsbdc director desarrollo san pedro team a grassroots entrepreneurial development organization at cerro de san pedro. community

commitment to transparency engaging aboriginal peoples in tailings management tailings management at the new a on mine is a major area of interest for our aboriginal partners and our neighbours. this was underscored in the a ermath of the recent mount polley dam breach which put the british columbia mining industry under increased scrutiny. as a consequence the provincial government issued a ministerial order requiring that all mines in bc conduct third party reviews of their annual dam safety inspections dsi as well as update their dam breach inundation studies and emergency preparedness and response plans. new gold having previously adopted a robust tailings management system as part of the towards sustainable mining standards knew it was critical to ensure that the third party inspection process was conducted in an open and transparent manner with involvement of our aboriginal partners. representatives of the tk eml ps te secw pemc and skeetchestn indian bands and the stk emlupsemc te secwepemc nation ssn were invited to participate in the annual dam safety inspection. band representatives were involved in all stages of the annual review process developing the terms of reference selecting the firm hired to perform the inspection participating in the field studies reviewing the dra report and commenting during the report finalization. new a on also voluntarily subjected the dam breach inundation study to an independent third party review process to ensure that this critical study was conducted at the level of rigour that satisfied both internal and external parties. aboriginal peoples are our partners at new gold we are proud of our strong relationships with our aboriginal partners. our approach is to be respectful and inclusive as we work to understand the goals and values of the aboriginal peoples in the areas where we work. we seek to engage early and meaningfully and to reach early agreements which reflect an understanding of the history of the area and its traditional uses as well as the needs concerns and aspirations of our aboriginal partners. we strive to directly employ as well as source services and supplies from aboriginal peoples. in addition we provide education training and apprenticeship programs to help aboriginal workers on their path to a career in mining. on december 31 2014 the new a on mine had 21 aboriginal employment. the rainy river and blackwater projects had 7 and 16 aboriginal employment respectively. our canadian sites collectively spent approximately 23 million c 26 million in aboriginal contracts in 2014. to identify opportunities in procurement and work with aboriginal business owners to make their ventures more sustainable over time we hired business development managers at new a on and rainy river. our partnerships go beyond hiring and contracting our aboriginal partners participate in environmental audits committees and reclamation projects. they also play a critical role in our e orts to bring traditional knowledge to the way we manage the environmental aspects of our mines particularly during closure activities. at new gold we believe our aboriginal partners bring signi cant value to our operations and our partnerships are key to our mutual success. being a part of our communities employees at blackwater. 12 2014 target 2014 performance 2015 target water establish a detailed water balance plan and water management plan at all operations. water balance and water management plans were established at all sites. complete gap analysis against the new gold water stewardship standard at all sites. tailings management no speci c target set for 2014. n a implement an independent tailings review board for each canadian site. 8at every new gold site we take a proactive risk management approach to safeguard the environment and minimize our impact. we established internal environmental standards in 2013 that were fully implemented in 2014 these standards are based on internationally recognized standards and industry best practices and they comply with or exceed all relevant laws and regulations. from early exploration we establish baseline measurements for flora fauna soil air and water. as mining operations are established we maintain robust monitoring programs to ensure any potential impacts to the environment are understood and minimized. we have comprehensive recycling programs and strive to reduce energy and water consumption. protecting the environment in 2014 we adopted relevant aspects of the alliance for water stewardship aws standard at new afton as a pilot program. the aws is a global framework that outlines what is expected of responsible water stewardship. we will be sharing learning experiences with our industry peers to help ensure that the mining industry appropriately manages this precious resource. water sampling at cerro san pedro. sunrise at new a on. 13managing cyanide responsibly new gold is a signatory of the international cyanide management institute icmi the global benchmark for safely transporting storing and using cyanide. in 2014 the cerro san pedro mine followed the mesquite mine in achieving certification under the international cyanide management code icmc. the peak mines however have not yet attained this accreditation. peak has made significant improvements in the way that cyanide is managed yet despite conforming to the vast majority of the icmc standards of practice peak was found non compliant with the standard that deals with wildlife tailings interaction. while historically the site can prove extremely low incidence of wildlife mortality and a robust procedure to further decrease risk to wildlife the criteria that the icmi has adopted meant that peak could not be certified by the time of publication of this report and as a consequence peak temporarily withdrew from the certification program. cerro san pedro achieves cyanide management code certification a er an intensive e ort the cerro san pedro mine achieved certification to the international cyanide management code. the mine began the process in 2010 by identifying areas for improvement. a pre audit in 2011 provided guidelines and resulted in an action plan to achieve compliance. as part of the recommended process informational meetings were held with nearby communities to increase their understanding of this highly sensitive topic explaining proper management procedures monitoring results emergency preparedness and response plans and the benefits and risks of cyanide use. environmental teams participated to ensure that complex technical issues were satisfactorily addressed and communicated. the plan was successfully implemented over a period of two years and in october 2013 external auditors completed the certification audit. in 2014 the mine received full compliance certification to the code which means the company s operations at cerro san pedro comply with all of the established principles relating to production transportation handling and storage operations environmental protection decommissioning worker safety emergency response training and dialogue. at cerro san pedro we have worked steadily to design and implement an appropriate voluntary cyanide management plan as guided by the international cyanide management institute so today we are proud to have achieved full certification. guillermo velasco environmental coordinator cerro san pedro mine icmc compliant cyanide facility at cerro san pedro. protecting the environment 14 collaborative research at rainy river the rainy river project began working closely with the ontario ministry of natural resources and forestry omnrf in 2010 when two bird species were identified as being at risk the whip poor will and the bobolink. ontario s endangered species act requires an overall net benefit to species at risk either by providing compensatory habitat or by supporting scientific research on the species. the bobolink adaptability was well known much less was known about the adaptability of the whip poor will. in 2011 new gold developed a collaborative research agreement between rainy river omnrf and trent university. the two year study of whip poor will biology was designed to support both scientific advancement and mine development. as a result of financial support provided by new gold a trent university graduate student was able to study how mine exploration a ected the physiology and behaviour of an endangered bird species. the student gained valuable research experience and our scientific knowledge of the species has been dramatically improved. future studies can now be designed to enhance species conservation e orts. gary burness trent university the collaboration between trent university omnrf and new gold has resulted in a new standard for responsible resource development in ontario. furthermore the study developed a better understanding of the range habitat and wintering territory of the whip poor will. demonstrating how industry and conservation can work together napier lake ranch conservation area new gold and its new a on mine have supported the nature conservancy of canada ncc in british columbia since 2011. the most recent contribution allowed ncc to complete the purchase of napier lake ranch. new gold has been a leader in demonstrating how industry and conservation can work together by providing both targeted and unrestricted funding new gold has enabled ncc to e ectively pursue and manage unique opportunities. thanks to this partnership thousands of acres of native grasslands in the nicola valley have been conserved for nature for now and forever. barbara pryce southern interior program director ncc the napier lake ranch conservation area encompasses a mosaic of iconic native grassland habitats and is strategically located along a migratory route important to many bird species. sitting in the heart of the nicola valley the conservation area spans an important ecological transition zone from mid elevation grasslands to douglas fir forests. furthermore as the lands border other conservation properties to the north and south across the douglas plateau a variety of habitats are now linked providing movement corridors for animals shi ing between summer and winter ranges. the key to making these grassland conservation projects succeed is to combine habitat protection with sensitive sustainable land use says barbara pryce. we must tread lightly on the grasslands. ncc will welcome walk in access to this future conservation area. grasslands are part of our natural heritage and everyone should know what it feels like to stand out under the big sky while the grasses blow around you and the hawks circle above. view over the rainy river project area. long billed curlew at napier lake ranch conservation area. protecting the environment 15protecting our water resources new gold mines apply e icient designs and technologies to maximize recycling of water during processing. all process water used in our mine sites is contained in a closed circuit with no water discharges to the environment. our monitoring programs are designed to protect surface water and groundwater and we are constantly vigilant to ensure natural water quality is not impacted in the vicinity of our operations. most of the water used in our sites is associated with the processing of ore. we also require water for dust control on mine haul roads and use dust suppressants to minimize evaporative loss. we strive to minimize water consumption. peak uses thickened tailings using much less water than traditional tailings and millions of cubic metres of process water is reused or recycled at all of our operations. in 2014 the raw water process ratio across new gold operations 0. 20 m 3 per tonne of ore processed has remained fairly similar to 2013 0. 19 m 3 per tonne of ore processed. working to reduce energy consumption and ghg emissions our activities result in greenhouse gas ghg emissions from the mobile equipment required to operate a mine to the o site generated electricity that we purchase to supply our operations. improving our energy e iciency and reducing ghg emissions not only reduces climate related risks to the broader environment it brings inherent cost advantages. an innovative energy savings program was implemented at new a on in 2014 and results will be closely evaluated with the goal to extend the learning experiences to other operations. in 2014 we reduced the use of gasoline and propane. however we used more natural gas diesel and electric power than in previous years. because diesel is the most significant portion of direct energy consumption the increased consumption of diesel has increased the ghg emissions per tonne of ore processed. electricity use also increased due mostly to the expansion of leach pads at cerro san pedro where electricity is used to pump solution to ore placed in leach pads increased mill throughput at new a on and to a lesser degree the addition of rainy river electricity consumption to the 2014 new gold calculations. the peak mines increased electricity consumption by about 6 as a result of increasing depths of underground mining and the requirement to cool the air underground. the mesquite mine reduced electricity use by about

management standard mines use a lot of energy but most mine operations assume this is just the price of doing business. the new a on mine took a di erent tack when senior management committed to being one of the first mines in north america to certify under the new iso 50001 energy management standard. the project was initiated in january 2012 with the certification audit scheduled for december 2013. the task was big the e ort was voluntary and the deadline self imposed. moreover the mine had no existing energy management system or detailed energy monitoring capacity and there was little experience within industry as no peer companies had achieved this standard. nonetheless as a result of the team s commitment actual iso 50001 certification was received in march 2014 demonstrating the company s commitment to sustainable energy management. the project began with investments in energy metering equipment and monitoring so ware. the next phase was the methodical evaluation of significant energy uses as well as the integration of energy performance into management practices. this required detailed planning and management support as well as communication training and raising awareness amongst employees. now that the system is up and running one of the biggest benefits has been more accurate information for allocating costs and identifying prime areas for energy performance improvements. an intangible benefit is increased employee awareness which is important since it is people not systems who manage energy. 2014 energy savings as a percentage of total energy consumed in 2013 was almost 11. reclaiming the land supporting biodiversity new gold operations practise progressive rehabilitation of lands a ected by mining activity as soon as areas become available a er operations cease. progressive rehabilitation and reclamation within our sites include a wide range of activities such as seeding replanting and removal of contaminated material. we also rehabilitate mining areas within our leases. each of our mines has obtained regulatory approval for its closure rehabilitation plans which are reviewed and updated regularly. at our sites we take active measures to protect and support at risk species and implement reclamation and conservation e orts o en through trusted partners such as local universities and environmental non governmental organizations. we have implemented the tsm biodiversity management protocol which requires the establishment of biodiversity management plans across our sites. for new gold environmental stewardship also means conserving or enhancing biodiversity on lands undisturbed by mining operations. as an example we have since 2010 contributed to the protection of almost 600 hectares of habitat outside of our new a on mining lease through a partnership with the nature conservancy of canada. operating mines in a sustainable fashion is the right thing to do ethically speaking and frankly the only way to do business successfully. new a on mine s energy manager lead of the iso 50001 certification project. eagle flies over the mesquite mine. protecting the environment concept and design the works design

5001,6280,Pearson_Environmental_Review_2016.pdf,environmental review 201 6 2 1. introduction as an education company we are committed to helping people of all ages to learn. we also have a duty to play our part in making sure everyone has a healthy and sustainable planet in which to progress. this thinking underpins why pearson has a long track record of investing in green initiatives. our flagship environmental initiativ e is climate neutrality but our commitment goes wider to embrace a concern to protect the natural resources on which we all depend. our vision is shared by others in the world of education and many of the institutions we serve are environmental leaders bo th in thought and practice. we know that our customers and learners value the commitment we have to being a responsible environmental citizen. in 2015 pearson reviewed its sustainability strategy through an inclusive process involving internal leaders w ithin the company as well as external experts. as a result we adopted our 2020 sustainability plan and confirmed our most material issues. this process confirmed greenhouse gas emissions and climate change as one of our nine issues which we believe as our most material at this time. we report on the highlights of our environmental activities within our annual report and broader sustainability reporting but also produce this companion report providing additional detail on our climate neutral commitmen t as well as on paper purchasing as our two most material environmental area s that impact on ghg emissions and climate change. 2. our climate neutral strategy in 2006 concern over climate change first emerged onto the public policy agenda rising up the list of issues raised by investors and was of interest to authors employees students and customers alike. pearson wanted to respond. we decided to adopt cl imate neutrality as our flagship environmental goal that we could use to focus the organisation on reducing our environmental impact. climate neutrality was achieved in 2009 and has been renewed and refreshed every year since. our climate neutral commit ment covers company operations under our direct control such as buildings and travel. the commitment excludes supply chain activities such as our digital supply chain paper purchase printing and distribution. our strategy is built on three key areas 1. measure. we have an established independently verified process to measure our climate footprint relating to our buildings and from business travel. 2. reduce. we consistently cut the greenhouse gas emissions relating to our buildings and business travel year on year. we have introduced energy efficient design across our buildings invested in alternatives to business travel such as video conferencing as well as purchase and generate renewable energy to meet our global electricity needs. 3 3. offset. whatever emissions we have not been able to reduce or avoid are offset each year by supporting a range of forest based projects that either save or absorb a tonne of carbon for each tonne that we emit. we involve all parts of pearson in achieving our climate neut ral commitment facilities departments work on introducing energy efficiency design and upgrades together with looking at renewable energy options across our main buildings. internal communications teams have helped update planet pearson our dedicated environmental collaboration space. it is available globally bringing together information ideas and signposts to local green groups as well as encouraging colleagues to work together. we also highlight environmental issues in our company newsletters. our marketing teams have continued to develop innovative partnerships to raise awareness of environmental issues and boost our reputation. editorial colleagues commission learning curricula covering a wide range of environmental issues. our purchasing tea ms have worked with industry partners and with suppliers on assessing and measuring our total carbon footprint. finance colleagues offer budgetary funds to stimulate new ideas and innovation. our approach development and implementation of our strategy is overseen by the responsible business leadership council. the council is chaired by the chief corporate affairs and global marketing officer and includes senior executives from across the company. progress i s reported to the reputation and responsibility committee a formal committee of the board. we have a network of country specific committees supported by around 20 eco committees at our key buildings that look for additional opportunities for improvement. pearson has a global online data collection system in place covering utilities waste water and business travel. as part of our due diligence we commissioned two independent reviews of the system. the first was carried out by deloitte in 2014 and l ooked at management and implementation of the reporting system and subsequently data verification is assessed annually through an assurance process carried out by corporate citizenship. 3. environmental management and measurement globally our operations are accredited against the carbon trust standard. pearson was the second ever organisation to be certified against the standard which recognises leadership in measuring managing and reducing year on year carbon emissions. our ca rbon trust standard certification was reviewed and reconfirmed in 2016. pearson first introduced its environmental policy in 1992. our businesses in the uk and australia are accredited against iso 14001 the international environmental management standard. other parts of the world apply our own environmental management system based on iso14001 standards. this system is described in the policies and downloads section on the 4 pearson corporate website. during 201 6 we secured accreditation against iso50001 the energy management standard for our uk businesses. we have also embraced leed the green buildings standard in the united states. we currently have six buildings certified under the leed standard which together account for over 740 000 square feet and we have set up a team of certified leed assessors within the company. last year our offices in hoboken became the latest to secure leed certification achieving a gold standard. we are currently working on securing a further leed certification for a b uilding in maryland. 4. climate footprint 201 6 our climate footprint as at the end of 2015 was 126 385 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent co 2e an absolute reduction of 13. 7 over 201 5 and 40 less than 2009 our baseline year. this means we are on track to meet our target of reduc ing our carbon footprint by 50 by 2020 compare to our baseline year. we are pleased with this performance as o ur overriding goal from adopting our climate neutral commitment is to reduc e our climate footprint where possible. our climate footprint reduction was driven by a continu ed focus on reducing energy use the distance we travel on business as well as wider business transformation. our climate footprint reduction performance for the period 2013 to 201 6 for our three largest countries and the rest of the world is as follows uk us china row global 2013 35 236 105 994 18 208 29 254 188 692 2014 21 599 94 348 19

6 by purchasing green electricity and then to offset the remaining unavoidable emissions. 5 since we completed our commitment to become climate neutral in 2009 we have reduced our absolute climate footprint by over 80 000 of metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. the nine most significant countries for us as sources of emissions in 2016 were the us the uk china south africa india australia brazil mexico and canada which together account for over 94 of our climate footprint. our approach we measure greenhouse gas emissions ghg relevant to our business and express our total as an equivalent in metric tonnes of carbon dioxide the main greenhouse gas ghg. this is known as carbon dioxide equivalent co2e. 83 921 77 579 48 807 ghg reduction for the period 2009 to 2016 purchase of green electricity forest based offsets united kingdom 14 united states 51 brazil 2 china 15 india 2 south africa 6 canada 1 australia 2 mexico 1 rest of the world 6 6 in our annual report we disclose all of the emission sources required under the companies act 2006 strategic re port and directors reports regulations 2013. these sources fall within our consolidated financial statement. we do not have responsibility for any emission sources that are not included in our consolidated statement. assurance our climate footprint has been verified by the specialist consultant corporate citizenship. the assurance statement covers the methodology data collection and accuracy of data reported. this statement is disclosed on our corporate website www. pearson. com corporate. external reporting in addition to this annual environmental review we also publicly disclose our carbon management performance to the carbon disclosure project cdp. 5. reduction our main motivation for adopting our commitment to become climate neutral is to reduce our carbon footprint. and the commitment has worked. over the last 7 years we have reduced o ur global climate footprint by 4 0 driven by a stellar performance in the us where we have reduced our footprint by over a half 51 . prior to adopting the commitment we reduced our absolute footprint annually by around 2 per annum but in the last 7 years our average annual rate of reduction was 6. we have adopted two flagship targets relat ing to energy use in our bu ildings and a second covering wider greenhouse gas emissions combining both buildings and travel. 15 61 18 5 1 scope 1 scope 2 scope 3 business travel scope 3 transmission scope 3 waste and water 7 2020 sustainability plan targets baseline year 201 5 201 6 2016 vs. baseline year to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 50 by the end of 20 20 using 2009 as the base year. 210 306 mt co2e 146 493 mt co2e 126 385 mt co2e down 13. 7 on 2015 40 to reduce energy use in our bui ldings on an absolute basis by 50 by the end of 2020 using 2013 as the base year. 285 590 mwh 215 177 mwh 201 041 mwh down 7 on 2015 30 factors behind this performance include our accelerating investment in digital content and the related switch away from physical related infrastructure such as distribution centres is reducing our directly controlled footprint. new technology which is enabling more flexible and greater home w orking as well as reducing the need for business travel. the green fund as a mechanism to stimulate investment and innovation. our portfolio of renewable energy generation projects across pearson buildings is an example of what has been delivered. continuing efficiencies implemented by the operations teams as well as strategies such as limiting business travel. case study lucid energy monitoring system we first introduced the lucid energy monitoring system ems in 2012 and it is now installe d in buildings representing 16 of the total us buildings footprint. the lucid ems system provides real time data on electricity water and gas consumption allowing facility managers to actively review their use more closely and work with local utilitie s to reduce usage and avoid additional peak usage charges. in its first 3 years utility costs were reduced by 12 the payback period on the 76k invested was just two months and the project delivered 945k savings over three years. nearly 8 million kwh of energy is now avoided annually at participating sites. 8 renewable electricity purchase our journey to purchase 100 renewable electricity started in 2008 and was completed in 2012. our most significant focus area for us is our largest market the united states. pearson has consistently ranked in the top 50 largest purchasers of electricity from renewable sources in the united states and has twice received a green power leadership award from the us environmental protection agency most recently in 2014. re100 during cop21 in paris pearson announced that we had signed up to re100 joining the then 50 companies helping build the market for renewable electricity. our cfo explained our reason for joining as this is the last generation that can take meaningful action against climate change. one practical step that business can take is through the purchase of electricity from renewable sources. pearson has acted and we already purchase 100 of our electricity globally in this way. we are now pleased to join re100 as by adding our voice alongside other businesses we can help shift this important market. coram williams chief financial officer for more information on pearson s commitment visit http there100. org pearson. renewable electricity generation our commitment extends to generating electricity from renewable sources at our sites. our first renewable electricity project went live in december 2009. ove r its lifetime the new solar panels on our building at old tappan in new jersey is expected to produce electricity equivalent to 4 325 metric tonnes of c02e. to date the old tappan solar panel project is generating 9 more than projected. during 2011 we installed a wind turbine in owatonna minnesota and completed a second solar panel installation project at our cranbury distribution center in new jersey. the cranbury project was among the largest company owned single roof projects in the world. 2013 saw a further 260 kw of capacity installed at our buildings in austin texas. we have implemented two solar panel installation project s in south africa. in 2016 one of these was sold as part of a wider initiative to reduce in house distribution centre capacity. we have invested in excess of 10 million in renewable energy generation delivering the following capacity kw 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 201 6 solar old tappan

business for essential travel we ve been encouraging our people to avoid flights wherever possible and we continue to lower the emissions relating to our car fleet. we have invested over 200k in upgraded video conferencing facilities in key buildings and introduced new virtual meeting technologies across the company. globally we aim to replace our fleet with hybrid and lower emission vehicles where possible. the number of hybrids in our global fleet increased from 33 in 2009 to 410 in 201 6 375 in 2015 and our aim continues to be to grow the number of hybrids in the fleet. 6. offset whatever emissions we are not able to reduce or avoid are offset through a range of forest based projects. through our efforts to reduce energy use and business travel we reduced our climate footprint as at the end of 201 6 by 13. 7 compared to 201 5. our footprint for 201 6 was 126 3 85 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide co2e. we avoided a further 77 579 metric tonnes through our global commitment to purch ase electricity from renewable sources. this left pearson 48 807 metric tonnes to offset for 2016 to maintain our climate neutral status. we did this through partnerships such as with the children s tropical forests uk the algoma highlands conservancy in canada the woodland trust in the uk and a new partnership in china. in the uk we support woodland carbon offered by the woodland trust. woodland carbon was the first scheme to meet the uk s voluntary standard for woodland crea tion projects which sequester carbon. our funding created over 20 hectares of new native woodland in heartwood forest in st albans. in north america our offset partner is algoma highlands conservancy. the algoma highlands area in ontario canada covers approaching 50 000 acres and our support is the anchor funding for the project. a wide variety of plants and wildlife species are being protected including rare plants and animals that are iconic to the canadian wilderness moose bear timber wolves o tters woodpeckers and loons. in china we have participated in the jiangxi province le an county forest farm carbon sink project. this project conserves the forest from commercial logging. th e tree species involved in the project are chinese fir and slas h pine. the children s tropical forests uk is our primary offset partner. for 201 6 we have once again agreed to purchase and protect rainforest in colombia adding to our commitment to protect rainforest in both colombia and costa rica in previous years o f the pearson climate neutral commitment. since 2009 our climate neutral program has seen us protect over 1 450 hectares of forest. 10 7. water waste and packaging water our offices do not use water beyond basic needs we set targets to reduce usage and it forms part of our climate footprint. we declare water usage data in our section on data. unsold product we sell a variety of products. most are paper based in the form of book s. less than 1 of our sales are products such as cds and dvds. we are committed to recycling as much of our unsold product as possible. sometimes this happens through industry wide agreements whilst other initiatives are specific to pearson. avoiding unsold product is a key business objective. improvements in stock control and sales forecasting contribute significantly to reducing the amount of unsold product and to lower cost. responsible disposal of unsold product is a significant environmental respo nsibility for us. 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 age change 2016 vs. 2015 98. 5 98. 6 98. 7 98. 9 98. 9 98. 6 98. 6 no change our target is to maintain our reuse recycle rate for all unsold books in excess of 95. this has been achieved since we set the target in 2003 and remains a target. packaging we use a variety of packaging materials in the distribution of our products worldwide cardboard plastic shrink wrap and foamfill a void filler. a particular objective for us has been to reduce the use of plastic and foamfill in favour of packaging based on natural materials. our use of plastic has reduced by over 85 over the last seven years and foamfill use is over 50 less tha n 2004. 8. supply chain pearson is changing. today digital services and direct delivery together account for considerably over half our revenue and as they grow in importance so having a technology related supply chain is reshaping our broad environmental footprint. nevertheless it is our traditional paper based products which continue to be the source of our most significant environmental impact. pearson is a purchaser of paper for books we have contracts with printers around the world as well as with distributors and shippers to bring our products to market. managing the environmental impacts arising from our supply chain was first identified as a priority for pearson over a decade ago and has continued ever since. including environmental responsibility as a co ntract requirement defines the nature of the relationship that we seek to build with our suppliers. in our contracts we outline the standards of performance that we expect from our suppliers as well as the commitments we make as a responsible purchaser. t he 11 standards we set our suppliers reflect the standards that we set for ourselves. pearson introduced specific environmental clauses for inclusion in key contracts agreed from 2002 onwards. these clauses were reviewed following supplier feedback and the introduction by pearson of a code of business conduct. we now have a companion business partner code which sets out the expectations we have of suppliers on environmental responsibility. in line with our commitment to climate neutrality we started the process of measuring and assessing product carbon footprints. our first product footprint completed last year covered the financial times and ft. com. we followed that footprint bug club bug club is a whole school reading programme for primary schools. it comprises books and an online reading world designed to help build a love of books and confident young readers. as bug club combines digital and print components it was a perfect case study for a life cycle analysis. trucost the specialist environmental consultancy carried out the analysis. as far as we are aware this is a first lifecycle analysis of a learning programme. the scope of the analysis covered greenhouse gas emissions air and water pollution freshwater consumption and land use change. the analysis used life cycle assessment to assess resource use and potential environmental impacts from raw material use device manufacture production distribution and reading. it the analysis reviewed the impact of different papers and printers used for the physical product as well as the impact of digital readers accessing books through desktop tablets or smartphones. the results were expressed in terms of a natural capital co st. this report highlighted supply chain water risk as an area for further study. paper paper was traditionally the single most material environmental issue for pearson reflecting our average purchase of some 300 000 metric tonnes each year approximately 6. 5 million trees. 0. 0 0. 5 1. 0 1. 5 2. 0 2. 5 paper a china paper a malaysia paper b malaysia digital paper a china paper a malaysia paper b malaysia digital natural capital cost ghgs particulate matter land use freshwater ecotoxicity marine ecotoxicity water 12 as part of the wider shift to digital at pearson the materiality of paper purchase has massively reduced and both 2015 and 2016 saw a significa nt acceleration of that trend. we purchased 43 000 metric tonnes of paper in 201 6 for our core and growth markets. key factors behind this reduction alongside the shift to digital are the transfer of paper purchasing responsibility in north america to lsc communications the sale of the ft group and the establishment of penguin random house. nevertheless paper remains an important environmental issues reflecting global concern about deforestation and illegal logging something that has been made easier to identify by developments in fibre testing which allows easy analysis of book papers by tree species. this focus is driven by th e loss of natural forest cover a s one of the biggest global sources of greenhouse gases accounting for 20 of global emissions or 10 times the emissions relating to air travel. as well as reduced paper purchase we achieved some key milestones in 201 6 pearson in the uk ret ained chain of custody accreditation by the forest stewardship council fsc. this means that pearson product can carry the fsc logo. core and growth has over the last 2 years more than doubled the volume of paper purchased carrying the highest sustainability rating fsc or equivalent certified. printing following the disposal of a small printing press as part of the financial times sale in november 2015 pearson no longer directly print s product. as such we do not consider emissions to water as an issue for our own company reporting. however emissions to water are an issue facing our third party printer partners. we see our responsibility as being to exert a positive environmental inf luence over the practices of our printers. in 2003 we first set up a central register of key paper suppliers and outsourced printing relationships. this register provides pearson with a picture of the environmental performance of its printers. the regis ter includes over 90 of our printers by value. we survey our global printers every two years. the survey covers whether the printer uses a recognised system for environmental management. measurement and reduction policies for water ink solvents alc ohol energy and waste. the survey was last completed in 2015. the overall results were as follows 13 we continue to be concerned that the release of volatile organic compounds vocs which are present in inks and solvents are managed effectively and where possible reduced. we encourage our printers to introduce and operating companies continue to monitor reduction targets for vocs as part of the work above. our production departments continue to use our vendor relationship management system which incorporates both environmental and labour standards data together with commercial data. during 201 6 pearson people undertook visits to existing and potential pri nters in the us the uk china and malaysia. these visits provided an opportunity for pearson to review performance standards in areas including environmental responsibility health safety lab our standards and human rights. the findings and issues identified have been discussed with our printers and are being managed as part of our normal commercial relationships. distribution our books are produced around the world requiring shipment from the printers to our distribution centres. we outsource road distribution and shipment of our products to third 76 71 80 75 67 92 positive resonse rate do you measure africa asia pacific europe americas australisia middle east 39 59 59 44 78 67 positive resonse rate do you set targets africa asia pacific europe americas australisia middle east 14 party carriers. we have worked with suppliers on consolidating shipments to maximise container loads and monitor environmental performance as par t of the contractual arrangements. we have an internal reporting process by facility. 9. engaging employees climate change affects us all. it requires leadership and vision to address and we all have a role to play. as most of our people work in offices test and learning centres or in data centres pearson has a relatively small and reducing environmental footp rint. however we can have a much more significant impact through informing engaging and inspiring the thousands of people who work for us and with us and the millions who learn with us every day planet pearson our dedicated green space is available to our employees globally. planet pearson is a way for pearson people to share ideas thoughts and to collaborate wherever they are in the world. the space provides ideas for carbon reduction links to local green groups and access to performance reports. we have around 20 green teams in place in pearson in buildings in the uk and the us along with country wide teams in canada australia south africa. 10. green products engaging learners climate change matters to our businesses. our operating companies continue to respond to the climate neutral challenge by developing and investing in environmental products and services pearson is market leader in the higher education environmental science textbook market with a 40 market share. we also offer master ing environmental science a collection of online homework tutorial and assessment products. across the environmental science list around 29 000 students are registered for the product. we are also a strategic learning partner for the us green buildin gs council usgbc and are working together to create learning materials and courses. over the last 25 years btec qualifications in the uk have offered a vocational pathway into employment or further study. as part of a wider suite of qualifications on sustainability skills the btec level 3 national in environmental sustainability was offered from september 2011. this offers learners aged 16 to 19 interested in sustainability clear progression pathways into employment or into higher specialist and profes sional courses. over 200 learners studied for btec qualifications in 2016. 11. commitments and targets our main environmental commitment is to be a climate neutral company for our directly controlled operations. first achieved in 2009 this means that we commit to reduce or offset our global greenhouse gas emissions by 100 each year for our existing operations excluding acquisitions made during the year. where it is not possible to reduce our emissions by other means we purchase carbo n credits. we have now continued this commitment into 201 6. pearson adopted a new baseline for data in 200 9. 15 last year we introduced new areas of focus for pearson. our progress is as follows focus areas targets progress carbon footprinting look beyond direct emissions to capture impacts across the digital and physical value chain. completion of an online tool to assess the footprint of the physical product from forest to distribution centre. completion of our first product mapping for bug club covering both physical and digital footprint low carbon economy continue to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy in order to remain carbon neutral maintained. pearson remains powered by 100 renewable electricity. also partnering with oper ations on a global energy optimization project that will map the opportunity for further energy savings in our largest 60 buildings. suppliers investigating whether 100 of data centres are supplied by clean energy early days work underway. presented on the issue to global procurement. not a priority for 2017. mindprint establish targets key initiatives and or partnerships to enable learning and skills development linked to specific sustainability challenges conversations are underway with wwf and the us green building council on the development of revenue generation ideas. circular economy closing the loop on all products and services by 2020 zero waste to landfill recent changes to the business model in north america he courseware is relevant here. we plan to explore whether there is an environment dimension to this commercial move. in addition to these broad themes we have a number of other targets target 201 6 progress plan s for 2017 and beyond review green team strategy in 2017. green team numbers fell to under 20 reflecting changes in the organisation al structure. we will now review the green team strategy in 2018 to allow the 2017 programme of cost savings to be completed. introduce total carbon footprint reporting. achieved. t ool i n place we will report further on this later this year. introduce total carbon footprint reporting. maintain our position in the indices of social responsibility achieved. pearson improved from bronze to silver status in the dow jones sustainability index and was again named as one of the global 100 most sustainable corporations in the world. maintain our position in the indices of social responsibility 16 target 201 6 progress plan s for 2017 and beyond to reduce energy use in our buildin gs on an absolute basis by 50 by the end of 2020 using 2013 as the base year on

and to ensure our compliance with national and international regulations on data protection. as a responsible corporation genpact is aligning its business plan and practices with the contemp orary sustainable development agenda. we continuously strive to sustain economic growth while reducing our environmental footprint. we are driving efficiency through resource optimization and waste reduction while realizing cost reductions in the process. our facilities are now being designed to reduce specific resource consumption and waste generation. the overarching theme is to decouple business growth from environmental impact. genpact directed efforts on reducing our environmental footprint per capita through several key initiatives. these include investments in renewable energy data consolidation and increased virtualization consolidation of disparate sites into intelligent buildings water conservation waste minimization transport emission reduct ion and carbon footprint

governance committee to assist in fulfilling its duties and responsibilities. risk assessment framework the risk management process at genpact can be represented in a systematic 6 step process risk is assessed and compliance is monitored across various levels in genpact. with the goal to establish an enterprise view of risk management that constantly evaluates exposure to emerging new risks and helps business in managing risks and decision support genpact has profile periodically and reports the key business risks to the genpact leadership committee and genpact board. the enterprise risk office is governed by this council and the risk responses are executed by risk owners across functions businesses and regions. the council meets on a quarterly basis to review assess the approach to manage key organizational risks. results are shared with the bo ard as well who are ultimately responsible for monitoring risk levels on various parameters and the management oversees implementation of mitigation measures. as a 1st line of defense the business operations and functional teams work as per their standar d operating procedures with built in controls and necessary checks and balances.

provide risk management services and control assurance. the risk based audit plan is approved by the aud it committee on an annual basis. this team focuses on process financial and compliance audits

agreed schedule on operations related to the service agreement and genpa ct provides reasonable assistance throughout. code of conduct we have adopted a code of ethical business conduct that applies to all employees together with a handbook further explaining our expectations integrity genpact. every employee is responsible f or his or her own actions and proper business conduct and ethical behavior are fundamental conditions of employment. any employee regardless of job or title who observes or becomes aware of unethical or unlawful activity is obligated to report such act ivity immediately. employees are also urged to discuss any concerns regarding improper conduct with the appropriate individuals. we believe that our actions should always be guided by our core values of honesty trustworthiness integrity dependability r espect and citizenship. our clients choose to work with us because we provide them with services that drive business value in an ethical honest and transparent manner supported by a strong governance framework. our rigorous internal controls business values and focus on controllership help us create enduring client trust. human rights practices 9 as a responsible corporate citizen we recognize and acknowledge that it is imperative to protect promote and uphold the human rights of all our stakeholder s across the organization and beyond. we are cognizant of the role businesses can play in enforcing the above and have instituted policies and mechanisms designed to ensure our support of human rights. our code of conduct and integrity genpact policies emb ody globally recognized human rights principles. we are thoroughly committed to providing our employees a workplace that is safe congenial and free from harassment of any kind. such a

information personal or otherwise in instances mentioned above operating ethica lly genpact is united globally on a foundation of unyielding integrity. this uncompromising integrity is why our clients entrust their business to us. an essential channel of projecting our principles and integrity directly in our work is through our emplo yees who are the true ambassadors of our values and commitment to unyielding integrity. our code of conduct communicates ethical practices and company expectations to all our employees officers directors and agents. we conduct year round programs to em communication from the leadership. it is always conveyed to all our people that our business vision is to be achieved without compromising our ethical val ues and integrity. besides our code of conduct our integrity genpact handbook also serves as a guiding map for employees when it comes to ethical conduct. the handbook is a reflection of how we have upheld integrity in our business conduct over the years and how we intend to continue doing so in the coming years. the integ rity genpact framework consists of five principles and nine policies grouped under four themes. the nine policies directly flow from the principles and serve as the means to achieve the goals rooted in these principles. a dedicated training course on integ rity genpact is mandatory for all genpact recruits. an ongoing training module is also run for all employees. in 2017 as of the date of finalizing this publication 94 of our workforce including senior management had undergone this training within the pr evious year this understates the number of people who have taken the training as it does not include anyone who is even a single day late in completion of the annual requirement. genpact supplements its ethical framework with a transparent and effective grievance redressal mechanism which we call our ombuds process. employees can access several modes to report any instances of violation of genpact policies. employees can report the same to their immediate supervisors management representative human reso urce personnel local compliance contact and member of the legal department or local global ombudsperson. in addition most of our major have the omb uds boxes as more and more genpacters are becoming more familiar with electronic means of communication email they are choosing to report via email where they can receive a response usually within a day. although employees are encouraged to sign their reports eemployees are permitted to report anonymously when an employee wishes to do so electronically the employee 11 creates a new email address via one of the free email providers. employees can also directly write to ombudsperson genpact. com. all empl oyees raising concerns or participating in the investigation of such concerns are protected under our no retaliation policy. by reporting non compliant behavior employees play a key role in preserving the integrity of the workplace. those concerns that ha ve an established response may be handled directly those that do not are submitted for final decision to a regional policy compliance review board pcrb which then decides the relevant appropriate mitigation measures. all communications and decisions ar e subject to review by our global compliance review board which is composed of the ceo cfo human resources head and general counsel. the audit committee of the board also reviews all violations on a quarterly basis. a total of 725 cases were reported g lobally in 2016 as compared to 637 in 2015 through the ombuds program. in the first half of 2017 460 concerns were raised by employees. approximately half of all concerns raised are on their face unrelated to genpact integrity polices but arise out of u nrelated concerns such as proper handling of requested leaves interpersonal issues or other matters generally referred to human resources. such a high percentage of unrelated concerns demonstrates employee trust that this avenue will resolve issues. a part of the increase in cases reported may be attributed to the significant expansion of our compliance communication program which strives to create more awareness about the ombuds program. in 2012 we had instituted a compliance communication program and have been leveraging it to effectively deliver the message to our employees straight from the leadership that integrity and business success goes hand in hand. under this program a member of the leadership across regional offices is assigned the task of communicating each and every month to employees about the ombuds program our no retaliation policy and another substantive compliance policy. a compliance calendar is prepared with a materials are provided by the global compliance leader at the start of each month to respective regional leaders. the primary communication mode is meant to be personal email messages do not qualify as compliant under the progr am. leadership engages with employees on respective themes through town halls executive meetings floor walks or huddles. these are then supplemented with detailed written communications. we also share actual instances where our employees or business par tners have fallen events and news items are also brought into the picture to portray real world examples and enable better understanding for our employees. comp liance with this program is reported monthly to genpact executive leadership. robust governance business excellence and long term value optimization go hand in hand with ethical business conduct. the principles of transparency accountability and equity s et the tone for our business relationships and underlying practices. our robust corporate governance framework ensures complete accountability fair treatment towards all stakeholders transparency and ethical conduct while at the same time creating an e nabling environment for sustainability to thrive in. this is

and standards across the organization. our proactive approach is evident in our extensive risk management systems. risk factors are identified measured and managed continuously and responsibly via our governance framework at the entity level busine ss segment level and business process level. this ensures compliance with not only applicable statutory guidelines but also with our internal policies and process compliance parameters. the overall 12 monitoring of risk levels is the responsibility of our di verse board of directors accompanied by the management team which is responsible for implementing recommended mitigation measures. as we chart our ambitious growth plans over the coming years our operations and processes will invariably become increasingl critical. our complex global operations subject us to regulation in many jurisdictions around the world which are themselves changing. our robust and agile systems are designed to w ithstand this change and dynamically adapt to meet these new and challenging requirements. we have always looked beyond what the law requires of us when it comes to our best in class governance practices. the world economic forum partnering

understand and live up to our high standards on responsible business conduct. as a responsible business we endeavor to cultivate sustainable practices across our supply chain encouraging and engaging with our suppliers not only delivering the best in class services but also better manage their environmental and social performance. ethical supply chain our supply chai n standards as an extension of our operations our supply chain is a reflection of our pride in doing business the right way giving due consideration to our ethical environmental and social obligations as we pursue business excellence. we expect our ven dors to comply with the same high level of standards on business ethics legal compliance and sustainable practices that we subject our operations to. accordingly our ety ehs standards all applicable regulations such as labor laws fundamental human rights and any other statutory requirements. specific criteria are also laid down based on the nature of the vendor. for example our food vendor must comply with specifi c health related requirements and our vendor for chairs has to comply with specific ergonomic requirements. further we have also adapted our integrity genpact policy for our suppliers supplier integrity policy. this extends the principles of responsible business ethics fair employment practices and prohibition of discrimination confidentiality and data privacy across our supply chain including all third p arties acting 14 on our behalf. we have drafted and implemented the sustainable supply chain policy that serve as a guide to ensuring a responsible supply chain. vendor governance framework we recognize that managing the environmental and social impacts of ou r supply chain has manifold benefits mitigating and addressing business continuity risks meeting the changing demands of our clients and other stakeholders increasing cost efficiency and operation efficiency of the supply chain protecting our reputati on and brand value resulting in long term economic growth. given our extensive supply chain ecosystem this is a challenging task comprising two elements ensuring stringent compliance to our standards and requirements and eliminating any risks associa ted with our supply chain. our supplier selection processes route all purchase requisitions through a centralized global sourcing team. genpact optimizes its sourcing footprint based on total cost of ownership including environmental impact and sustainabil ity factors when shortlisting a vendor. our supply chain it related services and products such as it hardware software it professional services and infrastructure and operations related services and products such as catering transport office maintenance and equipment while our existing measures ensured compliance through site audits and screening processes such as poli ce verification background checks etc. with vendor violations resulting in suspension or dismissal we recognized the need to further bolster the screening process. we enhanced the process to supply chain sustainability in 2013. recently we structured the risk and compliance elements under a vendor governance framework. the framework renders a holistic approach to risk identification assessment and mitigation with vendors being categorized for risks subject to the nature of their association engagemen t with genpact. all vendors are subjected to this assessment prior to being on boarded. vendors are required to declare their approach and present the supporting artefacts which along with the safeguards are reviewed and audited by our sourcing team. one of the key risk areas infrastructure norms regulations and ehs requirements. a signoff is required for the vendor to be on boarded. we ensure that all the eleme nts of the vendor governance framework including sustainability aspects are continuously updated to stay relevant with the industry practices and global norms. a committee comprising of senior leaders oversee the effectiveness of the risk framework and are informed and consulted for course of action if a risk is foreseen. also there is audit conducted to ensure that the suppliers are adhering to the safeguards that were committed. 15 vendor grievance mechanism our governance structure defined at the point of on boarding the vendor oversees the health and performance of the engagement. a periodic governance touch point gives an opportunity for both parties to discuss status and address any concerns. also this allows for structured tracking of any action pl ans that may be in place for addressing issues. suppliers have a point of contact in the business as well as the sourcing team whom they can reach out to during their term of service with genpact. in the event of a grievance being brought up for redressal the sourcing point of contact can bring on board the experts from legal compliance or other subject matter experts in the organization in addressing the issue and appropriate remedies and action plans are thought through. appropriate tracking points are defined to track towards closure of the issue to assure full accountability on our part to address the concern. green procurement our sourcing team is also actively involved with procuring green products for genpact facilities. the sourcing team colla borates with infrastructure and logistics ehs and it teams in order to procure products that help save energy and conserve resources. when procuring we prefer products that are greener given all required technical specifications are met. a database of g reen products has been developed with a recent addition for green building materials. expanding the green cataloguing of products to the key product categories is a continues activity in genpact. supplier diversity at genpact we prefer to empower new vendo rs from diverse groups provided they meet required vpq cost quality and delivery timeline requirements. 16 sustainability genpact

developed the above key elements of our sustainability strategy framework and developed a progressive and actionable sustainability roadmap for genpact in 2015. moving forward our aim would be to completely operationalize our sustainability strategy across the organization along with implementing the supporting governance framework and communication strategy to take us to a sustainability

ongoing operational excellence management supply chain excellence materiality this year we revisited our materiality assessment to prioritize aspects on the basis of their impact o n the to understand issues that are relevant to its stakeholders over the short medium and long term. materiality for sustainability is in essence simi lar to its accounting definition wherein issues that cross a certain threshold only become essential to monitor and report. this year we conducted a comprehensive materiality assessment which aided us in identifying and prioritizing key sustainability issu its impacts on society. materiality assessment pro cess adopted by genpact is summarized in the figure below. 22 stakeholder identification was done based on the stakeholder groups that our peers in the it ites sector have been engaging with. we covered eight stakeholder groups employees clients investo rs academic institutions government regulatory bodies communities ngos civil society networks industry bodies and suppliers. the questionnaires were prepared using the guidance provided by gri and the sustainability aspects considered by genpact and its peers in the past. we obtained the responses through a combination of online surveys physical questionnaires and personal interactions. management responses were obtained from all major functions heads at genpact across different geographies to get a well rounded organization wide perspective. the sustainability aspects were prioritized based on the responses and discussions during the materiality assessment. in addition to the materiality assessment exercise which is being conducted every two years we also engage with important stakeholders on an ongoing basis. for instance we conduct regular customer satisfaction surveys wherein in addition to rating the service delivery performance clients also share issues of concern to them. similarly we co nduct surveys with our suppliers on performance related issues and esg environment social and governance issues. we conduct consultations with our local communities to understand issues of importance to them and also gauge the effectiveness of our curre nt initiatives. since the results of such ongoing stakeholder engagement are also relayed to the management these views are also indirectly considered in our materiality assessment. the materiality matrix is shown in the figure along with some prioritize d aspects which were shortlisted for added emphasis in our sustainability strategy for next 2 3 years. it was observed that s ome aspects were ranked low or medium because they may not be relevant for the business or their importance has moderated over time since they have been well managed by genpact. 23 client excellence business continuity qualityof services

report 3hp inc. s vision is to create technology that makes life better for everyone everywhere. hp 2018 sustainable impact report 4letter from president and ceo our customers consumers and employees are passionate about the environment and social justice and they expect companies like ours to lead with purpose. 80 years ago bill hewlett and dave packard cleared out a small california garage to launch a business. with all the funding they could muster a grand total of 538 dollars they set out to create a di erent kind of company. one that pushes the boundaries of human potential and progress. an engine of innovation that not only creates value for its customers and shareholders but also for society. this mindset was decades ahead of its time and it has never been more important. because while we are seeing unprecedented technological innovation across industries we re also confronting serious societal challenges from climate change and other threats to our planet to persistent inequality that prevents far too many people and communities from reaching their full potential. companies have critically important roles to play in solving these problems not simply because it s the right thing to do but because it s a business imperative. a growing number of our customers consumers and employees are passionate about the environment and social justice and they expect companies like ours to lead with purpose. across hp our people and our partners are doing just that and it s having a measurable impact on our results. in 2018 our sustainable impact programs drove more than 900 million of new revenue a 35 percent increase versus prior year. yet while we are making signi cant progress we are nowhere near the end of our journey. we are doubling down on our commitments and seeking new ways to turn the challenges of today into the opportunities of tomorrow. this requires us to set our sights high. it s not enough to simply check a box and move on. it s about creating technology that is truly in the service of humanity. it s about always aspiring to produce something beyond products and pro ts. at hp we aspire to create a world without waste. from our supply chain to our operations to our technology and service o erings we are transforming our entire business for a circular low carbon economy. we are reinventing how we design deliver and recover our products to enable our customers to drive growth while shrinking their carbon footprint. and we are disrupting the global manufacturing sector with 3d printing technology that s making companies more competitive productive and sustainable. we also know that to achieve this vision we must be powered by diversity and inclusion. we are proud to have the most diverse board of directors of any u. s. technology company and be amongst the top technology companies for women in executive positions. attracting the brightest talent and building a culture where people from all walks of life can contribute and ourish is a cornerstone of our success. this work is not con ned to the walls of hp. we work hard to ensure our products are manufactured with respect and care for the people who make them and we have provided skills and well being training to more than a quarter million workers worldwide. and as we push forward on our journey we ll be investing to equip and empower communities to thrive. we believe education is a fundamental human right. we have now enabled better learning outcomes for 21 million people around the world well on our way to achieving our goal of 100 million by 2025. at the same time our people are investing their time talents and resources in their local communities. by 2025 hp employees will log 1. 5 million volunteer hours. across hp we are reinventing our company to meet the evolving needs of our business and the world we share. we will continue to adapt to changes and rise to challenges. and together with our partners we will lead a

traditional linear take make dispose production model is no longer viable. 1. 7x global resource consumption in 2018 occurred 1. 7 times faster than the planet s ecosystems can regenerate. 35we require a fundamental shift toward a more circular and low carbon model. companies that can grow without also increasing raw materials consumption will thrive in a resource constrained future and will be well placed to help customers do the same. our commitment to transforming our business model spans our value chain from our sourcing practices and operational excellence to how we design deliver recover repair and reuse our products and solutions. this transformation will rede ne how we function as a business and how our customers work and live through technology and solutions that enable entire industries to eliminate waste and drive e cient circular value chains. hp 2018 sustainable impact report 19hp promotes public policies cross industry initiatives and sustainable product standards that support progress in this area. in 2018 we endorsed the european strategy for plastics and the french circular economy roadmap. hp builds durable products that are easier than ever to repair and upgrade which extends their useful lives while reducing costs. several hp products have received high scores from the ifixit product repair site. for example the elite x2 1013 g3 an epeat gold tablet has an ifixit repairability rating of 9 out of 10. our elitebook 800 g5 business notebook series also received a 10 out of 10 ifixit repairability score. at the 2018 world economic forum in davos we joined the platform for accelerating the circular economy pace and in 2019 extended our commitment to continue transitioning our company and our customers to a circular make use reuse approach that seeks to close the loop for our products including capital equipment such as our digital industrial printing presses. as a member of the ellen macarthur foundation s global commitment to address plastic waste at its source hp is working toward an economy where plastic never becomes waste or pollution. to achieve this objective we must eliminate problematic and unnecessary plastic items from our products innovate to ensure the plastics we use are reusable or recyclable and circulate plastics away from the environment and back into the economy. hp works with homeboy electronics

impacts of commercial printing in 2018 hp saved more than 800 tonnes 36 of metal and plastics through the extended take back of spare parts supplies and used commercial print presses. during the last four years we have more than doubled the weight of raw materials saved through the return of hp indigo press binary ink developer bid components and in 2018 used more than 50 tonnes of recycled content plastic in indigo supplies. the click charge cost per print business model includes consumables which increases our incentive to deliver consumables in the most resource e cient way possible. all indigo presses collect and reuse imaging oil and the regenerated imaging oil rio system in our best selling presses further reduces waste oil by 20 50 on average. 37 by the end of 2019 we aim to increase the reuse of spare parts in hp indigo presses to 70 and increase the bid return rate to 80. transforming industries with d printing hp multi jet fusion 3d printing technology has the potential to revolutionize manufacturing and other industries and transform supply chains by providing on demand more localized means of production. this o ers enormous potential for the circular economy in terms of expanding product life reducing waste and greenhouse gas ghg emissions and avoiding the impacts associated with transportation and inventory of raw materials and nished goods. 3d printing can also reduce the amount of materials time and cost needed to make nished parts by realizing complex shapes or redesigning complex assemblies into a single part. 21 250 tonnes of recycled plastic used in hp products. 4. 34 million units of hardware repaired. 1. 25 million units of hardware remarketed reused. 133 800 tonnes of hardware and supplies recycled. 16 reduction in printers

carbon future climate change is one of the most signi cant and urgent issues facing business and society today. the science is clear and the urgency to act is increasing. at hp we recognize that addressing climate change is not only our responsibility but also vital to the long term success of our business. our vision is to transform our entire business to help drive a more e cient circular and low carbon future and to support our customers and communities to achieve more with less impact. hp s long legacy of environmental leadership and demonstrated commitment to climate action has been widely recognized. we support market and science based policies and solutions that aim to mitigate climate change provide transparency and accountability promote innovative technologies to lower carbon footprints and encourage the production and use of renewable energy. as part of hp s continuing drive to combat climate change in september 2018 at the global climate action summit in california hp and 20 other technology companies signed the step up declaration indicating the industry s ongoing commitment to accelerate progress. we also continued our support for the paris agreement as one of 17 companies to sign a c2es led joint business statement welcoming the work at cop 24 to set forth the paris rulebook to guide the implementation of the agreement. in addition we work to accelerate collective climate action through global programs including cdp to engage and drive performance with our suppliers wwf climate savers to share learn and adopt best practices re100

across our value chain hp was the rst global it company to publish a full carbon footprint. the understanding we gain through this analysis helps us target opportunities for improvement and drive progress. we were also the rst to set bold goals to reduce ghg emissions across our entire value chain and one of the rst 65 companies to have its ghg emissions reduction targets approved by the science based targets initiative. see more detail in footprint. emissions from our supply chain represent nearly half of our carbon footprint. in addition to driving progress on our own supply chain ghg emissions reduction goals we engage with and incentivize our suppliers to improve tracking secure assurance of their ghg emissions data and set science based ghg emissions reduction targets. through product design we continually work to reduce materials use a key driver of emissions in this category. materials extraction through manufacturing 18 600 000 tonnes capital goods 200 000 tonnes upstream energy production 100 000 tonnes transport 1 800 000 tonnes supply chain reducing the energy needs of our products is key to reducing our impact and supporting our customers sustainability

supply chains that close the loop on important materials. we are leading the industry on e orts to source and incorporate post consumer plastic into our products and keep it out of the ocean. feature closing the loop on plastics a legacy of leadership in closed loop plastic through 2018 driven by our planet partners recycling program hp has manufactured over 4. 2 billion hp ink and toner cartridges using more than a cumulative 107 000 tonnes of recycled plastic. this has kept 830 million hp cartridges and an estimated 101 million apparel hangers and 4. 37 billion post consumer plastic bottles out of land lls instead upcycling these materials for continued use. more than 80 of our original hp ink cartridges contain 45 70 post consumer recycled content and 100 of original hp toner cartridges 42 contain 5 45 post consumer or post industrial recycled content. in 2016 we expanded our closed loop recycling program to include hardware. during 2017 we launched the hp envy 6200 7100 and 7800 photo printers the world s rst in class printers made from recycled printers and other electronics more than 10 by weight. 43 in 2018 we increased the recycled content plastic in some hp envy photo printer models to 20 30 by weight. we continue to expand the level of recycled content in our products and expand into new product lines. hp envy photo printers contain between 20 30 recycled plastic by weight. hp tango is made with more than 30 closed loop recycled plastic by weight using plastic from recycled printers and other electronics. recycled content plastic makes up more than 33 of the plastic used in the hp t1700 z6 and z9 designjet printer series. hp business pcs and displays include 24 recycled plastic content on average. 44increasing post consumer recycled content across our portfolio 20 000 plastic bottles are produced every second. 39 8 million tonnes of plastic leaks into the marine environment from land based sources every year. 40by 2050 there will be more plastic by weight than sh in the ocean. 41hp 2018 sustainable impact report 26we are proud of our progress but also recognize that this is a challenge bigger than any one company or organization can address. to further advance our progress in 2018 hp joined nextwave plastics a global consortium of worldwide businesses committed to scaling the use of ocean bound plastics by developing the rst global network of ocean bound plastics supply chains. to tackle the global challenge of ocean plastic collaboration within and between industries is critical. through march 2019 716 000 pounds 325 tonnes of ocean bound plastic sourced for use in hp products. 795 income opportunities created for adults in haiti. 45100 children enrolled in school. feature closing the loop on plastics partnering to tackle ocean bound plastics in 2016 hp launched an ambitious program in haiti to help tackle the growing challenge of ocean bound plastics. in partnership with the first mile coalition and our supplier partners we have now built a fully functioning ocean bound plastics supply chain. through march 2019 we have collected more than 25 million plastic bottles to be upcycled into hp print cartridges and hardware products that s approximately 716 000 pounds 325 tonnes of plastic material that might otherwise have washed into the caribbean sea. through this initiative we have opened a new market opportunity providing a steady revenue stream for local collectors enabling safer working conditions and local educational opportunities. a haitian woman s reinvention story powered by hp and the first mile coalition feature fourth industrial revolution a more sustainable and inclusive industrial revolution with digital manufacturing as we accelerate into the fourth industrial revolution we are witnessing a profound transformation that will disrupt and reinvent virtually every aspect of the global manufacturing industry. hp multi jet fusion 3d printing technology is poised to help power this transformation while driving a more sustainable and inclusive industrial revolution. hp 2018 sustainable impact report 27hp 2018 sustainable impact report 28transforming jobs and economiesthe accelerating growth of 3d printing will disrupt and redistribute an estimated 4 6 trillion of the global economy in the next ve to 10 years. 47 jobs will shift around the globe with manufacturing migrating to places where 3d printing is fully embraced. by reducing upfront costs and enabling economically feasible smaller scale production this technology will also lower barriers to entry for start ups and established players alike while opening the door to innovative solutions that address our most pressing issues. in 2018 hp and key strategic partners launched the hp ntu digital manufacturing corporate lab to drive the innovation technology skills building and economic development critical to advance the fourth industrial revolution. reinventing supply chains and

siteimprove has been using our values people centric innovative and passionate to guide us in our mission of making the web better for all through our easy to use online web management solutions. these values and mission are embodied through the strategic work we do with corporate social responsibility and i encourage reading more about our work and achievements throughout the year in detail in this report. in the last year our revenue grew by 54 per cent and we hired 100 new employees and while rapid growth is not always easy the outcomes have been absolutely amazing. we have opened three new offices in norway canada and the netherlands providing job opportunities and solutions for real business problems. another key growth area for siteimprove has been the work we do in the accessibility sphere. besides updating our tool to the benefit of our 2700 customers we have also collaborated with key accessibility consultants to highlight how we help make the digital world a better place for everyone regardless of ability. the partnerships between siteimprove and these consultants all of whom are blind has cultivated in a number of hugely successful accessibility events in which people have thrived from seeing first hand the difficulties an inaccessible website can cause. in 2015 we also held our biggest accessibility awareness event to date in copenhagen in collaboration with the danish association of the blind. promoting global accessibility awareness day which occurs annually on 21 may we organised the world s largest tandem cycling event. promoting an accessible and inclusive society for all regardless of disability 200 people rode 100 tandem bikes to display a truly accessible copenhagen cycling experience. siteimprove employees prominent members of the danish community and blind or partially sighted members of the danish association of the blind participated. more than 350 people took part in the festive day including american ambassador rufus gifford and his canadian counterpart ambassador andr francois giroux. other prominent guests included klaus bondam ceo of the danish cyclists federation and bjarne corydon the danish minister of finance. upon course completion siteimprove donated the bikes to various blind cycling associations as well as blind individuals in need. another significant area of focus for us in the past year has been our employees wellbeing. after the success of the 2014 pedometer challenge we launched a campaign to coincide with world health day called fitimprove15 which was a series of global fitness challenges to get all siteimprove employees moving. letter page 5we used a mobile app to monitor participants fitness activities throughout april in two categories cycling and running walking. the four siteimprovers who cycled and ran walked for the longest time and longest distance in each category were awarded with something that definitely contributed to keep them on the right track a brand new apple watch proof of our ongoing employee satisfaction was seen by being named one of minnesota business magazine s top 100 companies to work for having also achieved the honour in 2012 and 2013. we credit this to having built a company culture that utilises the best of both worlds the relaxed atmosphere and open office space from denmark and the result driven work hard play hard mentality from the us. i would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees for their hard work. we will continue to move forward together toward securing our position as the world s leading provider of web governance tools and solutions. kind regards. morten ebbesen ceo siteimprove as part of our on going work to actively put digital accessibility on the public and private agenda as well as inform people about the challenges that disabled users experience when navigating the web and utilising self service solutions we have partnered with a number of disabled consultants who are able to educate through their own first hand experiences. read more about our advocacy partners valuable engagement with siteimprove later in this report. global compact principles 1 2 1. the company should support and respect the protection of internationally declared human rights 2. ensure that the company does not contribute to the violation of human rights page 7cycling in copenhagen a right for all in our continuous quest to increase awareness about accessibility we decided to in collaboration with the danish association of the blind dab arrange denmark s probably even the world s largest ever tandem bike ride. the goal was to promote an accessible and inclusive society for all regardless of disability and the date of the event coincided with the yearly celebration of global accessibility awareness day gaad on 21 may 2015. covering a beautiful 3. 5 kilometre seaside route in amager strandpark east of copenhagen siteimprove employees prominent members of the danish community and blind or partially sighted members of dab strapped on a helmet and rode the 100 tandem bikes to showcase a truly accessible copenhagen cycling experience. it was a spectacular sight more than 350 people took part in the festive day including rufus gifford american ambassador klaus bondam ceo of the danish cyclists federation and bjarne corydon the danish minister of finance. accessibility is a human right. may it be access to bike riding or access to the internet. morten ebbesen ceo of siteimprove. upon completing the course siteimprove donated the bikes to various blind cycling associations as well as blind individuals in need. on behalf of the danish association of the blind i would like to thank siteimprove for an incredibly well planned and well executed event. we have received so much positive feedback from our members it has been a huge success we thank you for your efforts that made it possible. thorkild olesen president of dab thorkild olesen president of dab rufus gifford american ambassador page 8 at the danish association of the blind we very much appreciate collaborating with siteimprove. it makes perfect sense for us to partner up with a saas company that works with digital accessibility since exactly this contains many challenges and difficulties for people with impaired vision. furthermore we are extremely thankful for the donation of no less than 100 tandem bikes. many of our members do not have the financial resources necessary to buy a tandem bike but now it will be possible for them to take part in the fun and join friends and family on bike rides. tanja vegeberg andersen executive committee member at dab page 9 our tandem bike was stolen about six months ago and since then getting around in copenhagen has proved quite challenging. my husband john is visually impaired and it was truly amazing to see so many happy blind and visually impaired people on bikes in amager strandpark. john rode a tandem with the american ambassador and when it was all over we brought the beautiful bike with us home. watch out copenhagen we re back on wheels nina faartoft member of dab thorkild olesen president of dab bjarne corydon the danish minister of finance page 10digitally accessible pdfs in 2014 we continued to increase the overall sustainability of digital accessibility by developing new initiatives towards a more accessible web for our clients such as the development of our pdf checker. as part of our continued focus on making the web more accessible we are constantly looking for new ways to improve our accessibility product offering. one major area in which we made substantial improvements was within the field of checking portable document formats pdfs for possible accessibility issues. it is a common misunderstanding that pdfs are inaccessible but in fact a pdf is a document format that can be greatly accessible to many users. with an easy and simple layout the new product enhancement makes it easier for businesses and organisations to ensure that all web content meets accessibility standards. furthermore in 2014 we developed two online accessibility certification courses for our us and european customers and in doing so became the first private company to do this globally. the certification is designed for customers who want to enhance their web skills best practices and develop their knowledge on accessibility. the two courses technical and non technical are offered online and available for the participant any time anywhere. each course consists of a series of videos and corresponding quizzes. the customer has to pass all quizzes with at least an 80 per cent final score to be awarded a certificate. improvements to siteimprove s accessibility service we firmly believe that websites should be accessible for visually impaired users as well as users affected by cognitive and physical disabilities. with more services becoming available online and some made exclusively available online there is an even greater need to ensure that all users are offered the opportunity to independently utilise online services. it is rare to encounter an organisation that does not want to make their website accessible however the very nature of digital accessibility can make it difficult to start addressing important accessibility issues. to make working with accessibility easier to our customers we made significant changes to our accessibility service in 2014 by assigning accessibility issues to three different roles. this way our users no longer have to relate to all issues but are instead presented with a list of issues relating to their skill set and knowledge. page 11webmaster issues assigned to this role focus on making sure that content is created simply and in a way that it can be interpreted by assistive technologies like screen readers. for example the b tag is often used to emphasise text on a page but b means bold and is related to the style of the content which means nothing to a blind user. by using a semantic tag like strong instead you are now giving an indication as to how the content should be understood and if text is being read aloud then this could be displayed through changing the tone. editor assigned issues that relate to the content creation process. for example when adding links on a page the link texts should always make sense when read out of context. link texts such as read more here click here should be avoided. developer as a developer it is important to ensure as many users as possible can use your web application. for example the use of colour. in order to make sure that all users are aware that an element on a web page has a certain function or status it is important not to give information solely by the use of colour. for users who cannot see colours or are affected by colour blindness that information can be lost. page 12our accessibility conferences in europe page 13sweden on 15 october 2014 siteimprove held our largest web accessibility conference to date at the quality hotel globe in stockholm. the event raised awareness about the new discrimination law that came into effect in sweden on 1 january 2015. stand up comedian jesper odelberg kicked off the event followed by kevin rydberg siteimprove s american accessibility specialist who went through how to get started with the process of making a website accessible. fredrik ahlkvist demonstrated how he as a visually impaired person navigates the web and then par lanner from the e delegation spoke about why it is important to have accessible web as well as the extended legal requirements. with fantastic speakers over 130 participants and a 96 per cent satisfaction rating the event was a great success. the netherlandson 16 april 2015 siteimprove held its first dutch focused accessibility event in the tranquil neighbourhood of soest strategically located between three of holland s largest cities. the five hour afternoon seminar designed primarily for those in the dutch public sector was attended by over 50 participants eager to learn about how to build a business case for having an accessible website. with an educational and informative line up participants were given the chance to learn quick tips and tricks from a real life case study as well as hear which direction accessibility legislation was heading in. renowned international accessibility expert professor jonathan hassell was one of the day s most popular speakers with his session on how to tie accessibility and a return on investment together in a way that could convince any management board to make positive changes. a recognised voice of expertise jonathan is best known for authoring the bs 8878 web accessibility standards in the uk. blind comedian and dutch radio host vincent bijlo also presented at the event and was met with squeals of laughter as he brought humour to the stage whilst highlighting the very real difficulties blind users face when accessing the internet. later on in 2015 siteimprove will host similar events in norway sweden the united kingdom and ireland. page 14 siteimprove s advocacy partners over the years siteimprove has enjoyed collaborating with many amazing partners who share our passion for creating awareness about accessibility and ultimately trying to make the web accessible for everyone. keith bundy fredrik ahlkvist and daniel gartmann are living proof that being blind or partially sighted does not have to be a hinder for accomplishing dreams and living life to its fullest. however the life of people with difficulties utilising the web could be significantly improved if companies and institutions worldwide went the extra mile and took it upon themselves to make their websites accessible. these men have all played important roles at siteimprove s accessibility conferences and we sat down with them to hear their thoughts. page 15keith bundy usakeith is the assistant dean for student development at dakota state university and is a jaws certified teacher. he has been a guest speaker at several events for siteimprove where he talked about the importance of digital accessibility and demonstrated live how blind people navigate the internet using a screen reader. what do you think of the accessibility conferences you helped us with in ontario canada in 2014 i think both events that i helped siteimprove with were extremely valuable in showing professionals the need for accessibility in the technology area. there were many valuable presentations at the events and i believe that ours showed that accessibility and usability are very achievable. one of our main talking points was that although it is true that attaining accessibility and usability takes extra work with the right forethought and a little dedication this is not a mission impossible. why have you chosen to collaborate with siteimprove i have chosen to collaborate with siteimprove for two reasons. one reason is my relationship with kevin rydberg siteimprove s eaccessibility consultant who i previously worked with at dakota state university. i was excited to see him hired by siteimprove and when he asked me to work with siteimprove it seemed like a great opportunity to help to promote accessibility and usability of software and technology. the second reason i collaborate with siteimprove is that it is a very positive stable and progressive company. i believe in what siteimprove does and i believe very strongly in the accessibility assistance offered by the company. what are the benefits of having an accessible website an accessible company website makes me feel valued by that particular company. it makes me feel like the company is putting forethought into reaching all members of the general population including those of us with special access needs. how do you think siteimprove helps create awareness on the subject of digital accessibility i believe that siteimprove helps to create awareness in several ways. the company has hired an eaccessibility consultant which in itself says that it wishes to promote accessibility. secondly this eaccessibility consultant is very visible in attending several technology events and doing presentations to promote accessibility. finally the accessibility certification workshops and the blog posts dealing with this subject promote an awareness of accessibility to the technology world. page 16what do you think of the accessibility event you helped us with in stockholm sweden in 2014 i thought it was a really good event where all the speakers complemented each other very well. furthermore i thought it was a great way to combine siteimprove s accessibility tool with a living example me of why it is important that companies make their websites accessible. why have you chosen to collaborate with siteimprove i think that we complement each other very well. siteimprove is trying to make websites more accessible which is something that i strongly stand for as well. what are the benefits of having an accessible website it is essential that companies address accessibility issues in order for their websites to be accessible for people with impaired vision. it is very important to share the knowledge in order for companies to understand that they actually exclude people when they decide to overlook accessibility issues. how do you think siteimprove helps create awareness on the subject of digital accessibility from what i could see at the event siteimprove reached a large variety of segments which i think is very important. fredrik ahlkvist swedenfredrik works as an external consultant advising companies on how to become more accessible in terms of digital information recruitment physical accessibility etc. he has been blind since the age of 15 but he has never let his disability become a hindrance in living his life. fredrik joined us at our event in stockholm in october 2014 where a newly passed swedish accessibility law was discussed. he also joined us in malm in may 2014 where he clearly demonstrated how important accessibility is as he browsed websites live using a screen reader. unsurprisingly the majority of the randomly chosen websites proved to be partially inaccessible which made them unreadable to the screen reader and thereby fredrik. page 17daniel works as a consultant specialised in information and communication technologies at ibos the danish institute for blind and partially sighted. he has a master s degree in spanish and social studies and has lived with impaired vision his entire life. daniel joined us at our accessibility conference in aarhus in november 2014 where he helped explain the importance of digitally accessible websites. what do think of the accessibility event you helped us with in aarhus denmark in 2014 i think it was a very exciting event with many visitors who showed great interest in what we are trying to do with digital accessibility and making the internet available to everyone. what are the benefits of having an accessible website i think it is very important to work with the issue of making websites accessible. from a consumer perspective it is essential that the internet is accessible in order for no one to be excluded due to e. g. impaired vision. but it is also interesting to look at from a company s perspective. if a website is accessible to everyone chances are also higher that more products will be sold. it is a win win situation how do you think siteimprove helps create awareness on the subject of digital accessibility siteimprove creates great awareness about the issue of navigating the internet when blind because their software focuses on making it possible for visually impaired people to independently navigate the internet. daniel gartmann page 18in 2014 a strategic partnership was established between siteimprove and the minnesota wild hockey team which play within the national hockey league nhl. web governance is the practice of managing the quality and consistency of your online presence through organised systems policies and tools which is exactly why the minnesota wild has partnered with siteimprove. the siteimprove web governance suite will also help the wild manage their website s accessibility. the nhl and wild both recognise that improved accessibility will provide a better experience for all hockey fans whether they are at the game or follow it online. a tool like siteimprove s will help us provide the best online fan experience possible. matt minnichsoffer manager web and creative services for the minnesota wild. siteimprove the minnesota wild hockey team page 19 gender division 188 employees world wide women 55 men 45 women

2015 world health day siteimprove launched fitimprove15 a series of global fitness challenges to get all siteimprove employees moving we used a mobile app to monitor participants fitness activities throughout april. during that time employees challenged themselves in two categories cycling and running walking. at the end of the month the four siteimprovers who cycled and or ran walked for the longest time and longest distance in each category were awarded with something that definitely contributed to keeping them on the right track a brand new apple watch furthermore all participants were entered into a random drawing for a 70 euro gift card of their choice. the same prize went to the best social ambassador award winner for being the one who made the most noise on social media. under the hashtag fitimprove15 we collected beautiful pictures of landscapes from the lakes of minneapolis the streets of london and the danish countryside as well as countless selfies of our sweaty fitimprovers to further motivate our employees we also held two short contests on 21 may 2015 when all siteimprove employees were present in the copenhagen office for our global meet up event. participants from all our offices around the world challenged themselves in a planking and push up competition with separate categories for men and women. the four global champions each won a massage voucher to help their sore muscles. fitimprove 15 let s get moving part 2page 24the goal with fitimprove15 was to motivate all employees to lead a healthier lifestyle with regular exercise rather than only awarding those who could run walk or cycle the fastest. we wanted to inspire people to get healthy and get moving regardless of whether it was a long run or simply jumping off the bus two stops earlier then they usually would have. this contest showed me i can move more which i didn t think was possible. said ranee flory us administrative assistant who won the walking challenge for the longest time spent moving. instead of wearing uncomfortable heels i just put on my sneakers and walked to the office in the morning. i realised i could walk for 60 kilometres a week instead of taking the metro. caroline olsson market analyst dk throughout the fitimprove15 challenge our employees ran and cycled more than 500 hours and more than 6 000 kilometres in total. we are very proud of their

100 companies siteimprove is very proud to have again been named one of minnesota business magazine s top 100 companies to work for having also achieved the honour in 2012 and 2013. we credit this to having built a company culture that utilises the best of both worlds the relaxed atmosphere and open office space from denmark and the result driven work hard play hard mentality from the us. page 29keeping a finger on the pulse page 30 annual employee survey siteimprove is a fun and successful company but also a company characterised by many changes and a high pace of work due to our 55 per cent annual growth rate. we rely 100 per cent on the well being of our employees which is why we try to keep a finger on the pulse by conducting an annual anonymous employee survey that tracks the overall well being and satisfaction levels of our employees. overall results from 2014 2015 management has become better at communicating goals and expectations expressions of appreciation and acknowledgement from management have increased compared to last year s results the work pace is high and some employees sometimes feel they get behind on their work corporate values are not

page 33minimising our carbon footprint as a saas company siteimprove is concerned with the inevitable c02 emissions caused by our many servers. storing the data needed to provide our services requires a vast amount of energy and we strive to choose the most sustainable solution. in an attempt to leave the smallest possible carbon footprint we have chosen a data centre that fulfils our expectations both in regards to being sustainably powered and energy efficient as well as maintaining optimal data security. our data centre in denmark interxion has received multiple awards for sustainability and supports more than 90 per cent of its energy consumption through sustainable sources including hydroelectric solar and wind energy. interxion continues to develop and improve its systems in a manner that affects the environment as little as possible. in may 2015 they introduced a new technology that utilises groundwater as a cooling agent for the data centre s servers. interxion describes the new technology as a system that both summer and winter delivers continuous cooling to ensure the right temperature for the servers alongside reducing the energy consumption significantly. the new groundwater cooling system allows interxion to store the cold air from the winter months to cool thousands of servers during the summer. this is yet another step towards their goal of providing a carbon minus data centre preventing any negative impact on the environment. these continuous improvements towards developing environmentally friendly solutions reassure us that we have made the right choice in choosing our data centre. dong energy partnership since 2011 siteimprove has been a member of a climate partnership with the largest provider of energy in denmark dong energy. through this partnership we support the production of sustainable energy in denmark along with more than 130 other danish companies. together we can make a difference. earth day on earth day 2015 siteimprove staff

facilitates better results. page 41our biggest and most extensive employee event in the past year was the global company meet up that took place in may 2015 in copenhagen. the event was planned in association with our tandem cycling event that promoted global accessibility awareness day. management invited every single employee to come to copenhagen to participate in the event which was the

l companies which contain voluntary principles covering a variety of issues affecting c ompanies social responsibilities. our social responsibility agenda is designed around five main areas. these are further described in the following. trustworthiness and quality are essentials for a me dia group our users must be able to trust our news and our products. we believe this co ntribute to empowering people in their daily life and thereby building more transparent so cieties. one of schibsted media group s foremost responsibil ities is to ensure editorial freedom and the right to freedom of speech. free media play a leading role in underpinning stro ng viable democracies. schibsted s articles of association states that t he shareholders shall enable schibsted to operate its information business in su ch a way that editorial freedom and integrity are fully ensured. the schibsted editors forum is a watchdog guardin g the principles of publishing within schibsted media group. editors forum consists of a pproximately 40 editors with responsibility for schibsted media group s media ho uses print and digital products. they meet twice a year to discuss common challenges and share experiences best practices and case studies from the world of publishing. the aim is to increase quality and standards of journalism within the group. in 2011 the schibsted editors forum adopted a fram ework for editorial governance applicable for the group s publishing businesses. t he framework enshrines the principle of editorial freedom and so explicitly defines it for the benefit of schibsted s publishing companies in countries where this principle is not embodied in local law. a schibsted editor shall promote the freedom of op inion and defend the democratic values of society with full respect of human right s equality and diversity a schibsted editor have the personal and full resp onsibility for all content including the advertising and shall secure that media act wi th

port the editors in chief present a yearly state of the union article describing editorial go als challenges and results during the past year. each editor in chief presents the report once a year to the board of each media house. the report will not be regarded as a subject for th e board decision due to the principle of editorial independence. the editor in chief may how ever answer questions about matters of interest regarding publishing and journalism. the g roup s annual editorial report will likewise be presented to the group board once a year by the president of schibsted s editors forum. please see www. schibsted. com for the annual editorial reports. during 2012 the use of mobile platforms for consum ption of news exploded. our media houses will lead the way in modern media consumptio n and we put the audience at the heart of everything we do. all our media houses have duri ng 2012 focused on digital development and have reviewed their product portfolio to ensure the relevance to the audience. our media houses provide content through multiple chann els giving everyone an opportunity to use media. the strength of the online news reportin g is in providing breaking news that evolves as the day goes on. on the web and mobile p latforms journalistic decisions must be made in a fraction of the time available in traditi onal media however the quality and credibility of the content cannot be jeopardized. even if the media landscape is changing the role o f the media is still the same. by illuminating and facilitating discussions of critic al aspects in the society media is moving the society forward. one of the most powerful strengths of the media is the ability to effect change. with new digital platforms schibsted belie ves that the work of our media houses may be performed even better. the digital revolutio n gives new opportunities for live reporting and involving our readers in the news cov erage. the quality of information published is higher due to more diverse techniques for storytelling e. g. through web tv. mobile platforms also makes it easier for readers t o give feedback to the media houses and our journalists are even more conscious regarding q uality of content and transparency as the journalists themselves may be part of the online de bate. digital journalism involves readers and users in ne w ways. as an example in 2012 vg published an article online where the journalists h ad mapped the stories of 40 norwegians that had their life ruined due to wrong medical tre atment or failure in national health service. in the online article vg invited their readers to publish their own stories related to this topic. approximately 100 stories were told by vg s readers and even if these stories are subjective the sum of stories tells something abou t a part of the national health service that is important to illuminate. in all our media houses articles published on onli ne platforms are open for comments from readers. most of our media houses require people to be logged in through e. g. facebook twitter google to be able to comment on articles. this is to prevent harassment threats and hateful comments. the media houses have moderators monitoring the debates and removing comments considered as inappropriate. in addition to traditional news reporting our medi a houses have also created several new meeting places for our users places where they ca n share knowledge and experiences with other users. schibsted media group is a large player in the clas sifieds market. our classifieds sites are marketplaces that enable transactions of goods betw een individuals. in several of our markets the classifieds sites have become a peopl e s movement where secure and simple solutions creates new possibilities for the consume rs. in our mature markets the users add value to the marketplace through inventing new ways of trading. the marketplaces are simple practical and right next door bringing a pe rsonal relationship between buyer and seller. our online classifieds sites are also consi dered as portals for consumer s retrieval of information. consumers are using our marketplaces t o search for relevant information to use in their daily life. our marketplaces empower peopl e to help each other in useful ways and thus fit perfectly with the group s mission. as an example in 2012 approximately 300 000 new jo b ads were posted on our job classifieds site in spain in 2012. with the high un employment rate in spain this service contributes to helping people find a job in a tough job market. all the online marketplaces operate under a set of rules to prevent both fraud and advertisement of illegal and unethical goods. manua l and automatic ad reviewing processes are in place locally to ensure that weapons drugs and other illegal or counterfeit items are not advertised on the sites. all sites also have a zero tolerance policy against pornography and prostitution. in 2011 schibsted payment was formed to establish a single sign on and payment solution for the schibsted companies. spid is the primary pr oduct of schibsted payment delivering an easy and secure way to log in and pay across man y services. the goal is to make digital identification and payment safe and easy for users and service content providers. schibsted media group has launched new services tha t contribute to increased transparency in the fields of consumer services. th e services are easy to use and an efficient way for consumers to compare different se rvice providers. an example is lendo a marketplace for consumer loans in sweden and norway. when a customer submits an application for a consumer loan through lendo the consumer will receive offers from several banks making it easier to compare the terms and the n choose the bank with the most favorable terms. in 2012 lendo sweden and sweden s central bank riksbanken started a joint study to better understand how an online ma rketplace for consumer loans is affecting the competition within the industry for consumer lo ans. the study will also look into how increased transparency in such a market affects the household s borrowing costs availability of credit and the behavior of the banks and the hou seholds. penger. no is another example of a service increasin g transparency. the free online service will make it easier for norwegians to find a mortga ge loan online. this is the first time the norwegian bank community is gathered on one website. consumers can obtain offers from up to three banks at the same time. good corporate governance is an important premise f or achieving our mission and vision. schibsted media group emphasizes openness transpar ency accountability equal treatment and a long term perspective in our way of doing business. for more information on governance in schibsted media group please refer to the statement of corporate governance in our annual report. the tinius trust was founded by schibsted s previou s largest owner tinius nagell erichsen. the ownership must uphold the freedom an d independence of schibsted s media services said tinius nagell erichsen. his justifi cation for setting up the trust was to consolidate his ownership interest in the schibsted group so that the ownership can create confidence that schibsted s newspapers and other me dia outlets would always be able to maintain their position as free independent outlet s. tinius wanted to use his influence to protect schibsted as a group with free and independ ent editors characterized by

employment and safe working conditions and maintain high environmental standards. the sustainability policy details our commitment to continuously reduce the environmental impact of our own operations and to engage in activities that have positive socio economic impacts and promote the vision of communication for all. cr is rmly embedded in our global assessment program. ericsson expects the same standards of labor and environmen tal performance among all suppliers. during 2011 we completed the annual sustainability and cr review with the ericsson board of directors and the ongoing sustainability and cr e learning program is mandatory for all new employees as part of the new employee learning milestones. human rightswe actively support the ful llment of human rights within our sphere of in uence. our rst obligation is to avoid complicity in human rights abuse but ericsson s core technologies can also help improve lives and promote democratic societies and contribute to socio economic development. we are committed to actively work with the un guiding principles for business and human rights published in 2011. our code of business ethics now re ects these guiding principles which will be acknowledged by all employees in 2012. we established a sales compliance board as part of our governance framework. a study conducted jointly by ericsson arthur d. little and chalmers university of technology in sweden in 33 oec d countries quanti es the isolated impact of broadband speed. doubling the broadband speed for an economy increases gdp by 0. 3. ericsson initiated work on a socio economic impact assessment framework looking at how ict can positively impact lives at the individual and community level. we were co sponsors of the report leveraging information and communication technology for the base of the pyramid examining 280 initiatives in asia latin america and africa that used ict for delivering education health agriculture and nancial services at the bottom of the pyramid. the supplier code of conduct s coc program has been implemented in all regions and business units. about 392 s coc audits and 270 on site assessments were performed. we are addressing the issue of con ict minerals through our own supply chain initiatives and by working towards common sector wide solutions. fair labor practiceshuman resources procedures ban discrimination and ensure equality and diversity in our operations. we encourage union membership and in countries where workers cannot freely choose membership work conditions are discussed with local management in a structured format. ericsson group achieved a global occupational health and safety assessment series ohsas 18001 certi cation. our code of conduct stipulates that as far as any relevant laws allow all employees are free to form and to join trade unions or similar external representative organizations and to bargain collectively. subjects covered include health and safety remuneration training work time exibility equal opportunity and restructuring. we estimate that approximately one third of all employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. in some markets we have established other mechanisms for informing and consulting with employees. we fund independent research on health and safety issues relating to radio waves and electromagnetic elds em f. the ten principles of the un global compact provide a universal framework for business conduct which ericsson strongly endorses. ericsson s commitment to the ten principles of the un global compact guides us in the development of group practices throughout our sphere of in uence. through initiatives like refugees united and connect to learn ericsson response and the millennium villages we mobilize our core business to support the un in its efforts to alleviate poverty improve the environment and bridge the digital divide. ericsson 2011 sustainability and corporate responsibility report

chair of the working group on climate change which in 2011 issued a report the broadband bridge linking ict with climate action for a low carbon economy. the report discusses how broadband can help cut carbon emissions as well as aid climate change mitigation and adaption supported by best practice cases from around the world and a set of policy recommendations to accelerate the role of ict in the low carbon economy. at cop 17 we launched the transformative step of the day together with the global e sustainability initiative gesi. while the carbon footprint intensity reduction was lower this year compared to last ericsson is well on track to meet its ve year target which aims to reduce the carbon emission intensities by 40. one signi cant environmental aspect is the energy consumption of our products during operations. ericsson has increased 3g 4 g energy ef ciency by 85 in radio base stations over the last decade. we take environmental aspects such as hazardous substances producer responsibility and ef cient use of resources into account in product design procurement production and operation. as part of our extended producer responsibility of all material collected and processed during 2011 less than 2 was sent to land ll and more than 98 was recovered. we have increased the amount of reuse to 5 of the total volume treated. our environmental management

support to the global compact. our management manual is based on the principles of sa8000 and in addition to this we nd the global compact a valuable tool in our social responsibility as well as environmental work. odense april 2016 philippe gueniau managing director rice a s contents people care we care 3company facts 3management tools 3suppliers 4audit process suppliers 5audit process

sales o ces 14 employees sourcing o ce thailand 7 employees happy cooking kitchen 3 employees management tools rice a s supports the global compact and uses it as a guideline for doing business responsibly. the objective of the un initiative global compact is to promote good business behavior and the management tool is centered on the areas of human rights labor environment and anti corruption. back in 2001 rice decided to formalize the di erent initiatives within social accountability in an overall manage ment tool. we decided to use the standard sa8000 the international standardized code of conduct for improving working conditions around the world. the spirit of this standard is close to our core business values. furthermore there is an audit system connected to the tool just as the system is based on human as well as labor rights. since 2006 rice has committed to apply to the global compact principles as a management tool and as it will appear in the principles sa8000 and global compact are to some extend quite close. in 2002 we obtained the sa8000 certi cation as the rst scandinavian company and we have used it as both a check list as well as a way of dealing with the developmental pro cess of our suppliers ever since. the central areas of sa8000 are child labor forced or compulsory labor health safety freedom of association right to collective bargaining discrimination disciplinary practices working hours remuneration management systems suppliers 4the nature of our business is to launch two major and two minor collections each year. when developing these col lections we are working with a substantial number of per manent suppliers with whom we engage in a long lasting cooperation. additional to this we have seasonal suppliers or one time suppliers who contribute only in the current collection. to ensure a strong cooperation we have established our own sourcing o ce in thailand. the sourcing o ce is sta ed with rice employees which enables us to be very close connected to our suppliers. the aim is to continuously work on building a socially responsible business all over the world. the fully operational sourcing o ce has the respon sibility of coordinating with our suppliers the sampling and handling of purchased orders the follow up on production quality control processes shipping and nally but not least the audit in connection with social compliance. the audit is mandatory for all suppliers and the follow up focuses on permanent suppliers with whom we engage in long lasting cooperations. deitptmgincnvnthsuppliers 5audit process suppliers the audit process with our suppliers is of great importance to us. when we choose new suppliers we make sure that they uphold ethical standards. where improvements are needed we engage in cooperations with the supplier and use the sa8000 standard as a tool in the developmental pro cess. we start by taking a commitment from the new supplier in relation to the sa8000 standard. the managing director of the supplier must sign this commitment which relates to sa8000 as well as environmental protection. once the production is initiated and the rst order is com pleted from the supplier we have our own sta visiting the supplier in order to make the quality control of products as well as the rst physical audit in the factory. the audit is conducted at least every second year in order to maintain the obligations of the factory. we always strive to make the audit process the most e cient and therefore our audit in china is in most cases carried out by a third party 70 ex ternal 30 internal. we have developed standard tools for our auditors to use during the audits. with a standard form the results are more reliable and it is easier for the rice headquarter to stream line the results from the audits around the world. when our auditor nds topics not meeting the expectations in accordance to the sa8000 standard we issue a non con formity report. during the next visit we will then follow up to control that the non conformity has been solved. denmark 6audit process denmark in order to make sure that we comply with our own standards we made an agreement with bureau veritas certi cation. bureau veritas certi cation carries out an audit of rice once a year according to the sa8000 standard. the auditor goes through the following program opening meeting walk around in the premises personal interviews with the sta review of records control of suppliers internal monitoring outside communication management review closing meeting during the audit the auditor will check our audit reports from the factory visits as well. these reports will also contain a description of elds where there are room for im provement. working environment at the headquarters the working environment in our danish headquarters is controlled by the apv workplace assessment. the assess ment is updated at least every three years with inputs from the sta. at rice we are aware of the importance of good working conditions among our employees and in 2015 we reorganised the o ce at the headquaters to ensure better working conditions and less noise. our employees at the headquarters have the opportunity to join a tness program once a week during working hours. furthermore the most recent addition is the voluntary yoga class which takes place after working hours once a week. we believe that taking good care of our employees is an in vestment which both pleases the individual employee and at the same time prevents physical problems and keeps ab sence of employees due to illness at a low level. we also o er the sta a healthy lunch ve days a week cooked by happy cooking by rice located at the head quarters. we have a health and safety committee to take care of any possible issues that might be brought up by the sta. the sta select among themselves a representative and likewise there is an appointed management representative in this group. once a year we conduct a re drill for all employees just as all employees are o ered a guided safty tour. finally a sa8000 headquarters worker representative has been selected by the employees. sa8000 7sa8000 recerti cation in november 2014 rice achieved a sa8000 recerti cation and was thereby found to be in accordance with the require ments of the management system standard. in october 2015 the announced surveillance was conducted with success. in order to stay on top of the standard the french consult ant company acta verba guides us on the sa8000 certi ca tions. the recerti cation takes place every three years and consists of two and a half days of audit at the rice headquarters. communication 8communication communicating about social responsibility is important for rice and we use both our website and our social media channels to talk about current csr projects and the impor tance of taking action. rice participated once again in the campaign world s best news a danish news campaign working to raise awareness about the great progress taking place in the developing countries especially focusing on tracking and reporting the outcome of the un millennium development goals. the campaign is based on a unique cooperation between the un the danish ministry of foreign a airs development agency danida over 100 danish development organiza tions and 100 corporate partners. at the national campaign day rice launched an event for all employees at the headquarters with the aim to raise aware ness about the campaign. furthermore rice committed to raise awareness on social media. anti corruption at rice we aim to be close to our suppliers and with audits quality control product testing and strong external coopera tion we strive to avoid any kinds of corruption. anti corrup tion is of great importance to us and we always consider the risks when engaging with new suppliers. obviously we have a no tolerance policy towards corrup tion and we believe that it raises transaction costs under mines fair competition distorts development and impedes long lasting foreign and domestic investment. csr collaborations 9rice csr projects and donations at rice we rmly believe that no one can help everyone but everyone can help someone corporate social responsibility is a part of the rice dna and working actively with corporate social responsibility is a big part of our ethical values. rice csrspoon full of hope ii we redesigned the spoon full of hope and this time the sale of one spoon equaled 24 servings of soup. we sold 3752 spoons. spoon full of hope iiithe

transformation. the merger has implied sacrifices and significant workloads. our employees have demonstrated high levels of excellence in their work during this entire process. this undoubtedly

corporate practices. i would like to take the opportunity to thank all the members of the board who dedicated so much time and effort into building the strong bank of mexico. to mr. rodolfo barrera villarreal mr. eugenio clariond reyes retana mr. jacobo zaidenweber cvilich and mr. isaac hamui mussali my deepest gratitude for the years of dedication loyalty and service on the board of directors

the needs of mexican families and companies. there are many areas of opportunity and we will invest time and resources to continue modernizing and constantly improve the services that we provide to customers but certainly today banorte has a highly competitive service platform. one of the most important challenges we faced this last year was a very uncertain international economic of these countries leading to a shortage of liquidity that practically drove these institutions to insolvency. labor markets to give more opportunities to young people and a cleanup of the bank s balance sheets and their recapitalization among other things. mexico has fortunately come out of this episode of international uncertainty relatively untouched for the moment. although the exchange rate interest rates of mexican bonds and the stock market have mexican operations. despite this complex global environment the mexican economy maintained a rate of economic growth above the average of the last decade driven by greater domestic demand. also the bank of mexico and the level of public debt as a percentage of the gdp continued to decline. the banking system showed adequate capitalization levels and asset quality while loans granted by banks to the private sector grew by 16. all this contributed to improve the perception of the future performance of our economy. in the case of grupo financiero banorte our loan portfolio grew faster during 2011 compared to the system increasing by 33 annually. this was due in part to the merger with ixe but also to favorable dynamics in all sectors. even when excluding the impact of the merger with ixe the loan portfolio increased by annual report 2011 920 annually above the average of the banking system. this was achieved along an important increase of 29 in core deposits as well as one of the lowest levels in past due loans in the system at only 1. 9. these achievements have allowed us to consolidate our a market share of 14 of the total loans in the system and 13 of deposits. regarding corporate governance 2011 was a very relevant year for the financial group. first we obtained a majority approval in the shareholders assembly of all the corporate acts necessary to achieve the merger with ixe grupo financiero including the corporate restructuring the capital increase and the share exchange. this enabled us to successfully carry out the merger between both financial groups and achieve to date all the also obtained all the approvals from our corporate bodies to merge with afore xxi and thus consolidate this retirement fund manager as the most important in the country. on the other hand the number of members sitting on the board of directors was decreased to a maximum of 15 and some changes in board members were made as part of the renewal cycles required by international best practices. we were able to increase the number of independent members to 53 more than double the percentage required by the stock market law mexico integrating top talent while at the same time including some of the former ixe shareholders. we also created 5 boards in diverse regions of the country which provide advice to the board of directors on the business trends in their localities and make proposals about products and services according to the region. also the nominations committee was created whose functions include proposing board of directors candidates to the shareholders assembly. we were also able to align the corporate governance bodies of ixe and banorte building the institutional framework required by a larger and more complex institution and changes were made to the organizational structure to adapt to a new operational reality. guillermo ortiz chairman of the board of directors of grupo financiero banorte payment of dividends to the performance of the financial group the shareholders meeting in october approved to modify the dividend policy. are adequate measures to continue advancing towards alignment with international best practices. social responsibility ranking among the top three main banks in the ft sustainability awards and being selected as one of the quoted

about their interests their expectations and their role in how we conduct our business. exchanging with our stakeholders is also a good way to assess our impacts on them. integrate their expectations it was not enou gh to engage a dialog with our stakeholders. the key issue is to integrate their expectations if possible in our development evaluate our impacts knowing our impact on our stakeholders helped us integrating their expectations in our development strategy trying to make the latter more sustainable. we con ducted a full assessment of our impacts but also of the risks we are facing and the opportunities arising from sustainable development. define our strategy once we integrated our stakeholders commitments and evaluated our real and potential impacts on them we built a complete

sustainable development report 2013 xx reduce our environmental footprint objective 5 reduction in electricity consumption per slab by 2016 compared to 2012 pre serving the environment is the best way to ensure the sustainability of our business issues environment is at the core of our business. using natural raw materials we provide solutions to o ur customers for the growin g of food crops in greenhouses. we always try to make our decisions integrating environmental consideration s and thinking about the way we can improve our impacts. our production processes are not energy and water intensive but these issues are important to us. we also work at lowering our office environmental impacts through the reduction of paper consumption. energy. our production process only uses electricity to power the sieving and hydraulic press machines and the lighting system. in sri lanka elec tricity is mostly generated by hydropower plants which lowers our potential carbon emissions due to energy consumption. however our production cannot suffer any electricity blackouts so that from time to time we have to use fuel generated emergency gene rat ing set to produce electricity. nevertheless we are continuously improving our machines to lower their energy consumption in order to lower our environmental impacts but also to decrease our energy related costs. in addition for future developments we are studying the possibility to install at one of our production site some alternative renewable energy production systems su ch as solar panels or mini wind power plant. in 2013 we have developed a monitoring tool to follow our electricity consumption. before thinking about ways to use more renewable energy to power our factories we believe that it is in the environment and in our best interests to reduce our electricity consumption first. biogrow lanka sustainable development report 2013 20 biogrow commits to respect national and international environmental legislations biogrow commits to protect the environment the natural resources and biodiversity and to progressively and continuously reduce its environmental impacts notably due to energy water and paper consumption biogrow commits to forbid from it s practices any actions that would jeopardize and deteriorate the local environment biogrow lanka sustainable development report 2013 21 electricity consumption in kwh as of september 2013 and covering all our electricity consumption has decreased over time while we increased our production capacity and volumes an d mechanising our production conveyors new machines. w e continuously work at modernising our production capacities while reducing our electricity consumption. for 2010 the lack of aggregated data covering a similar scope as for 2011 2012 and 2013 do es not represent the actual sites but only of our administration office in negombo. we are on the right path to reduce our electricity consumption. electricity consumption per slab in wh we have designed an objective for our electricity consum ption per slab of cocopeat. we believe this target is a relevant and efficient mana gerial tool. reaching a x re duction with 2012 as a baseline of our electricity consumption per slab is ambitious and we believe that great efforts remain to be done before 2016 to reach this objective. in september 2013 we are still behind our objectiv es but sure that we will be back on tracks to reach our 2016 objective by the end of 2013. the installation and use of more energy efficient machines will help reach this target. water. our only sources of water consumption are located in two phases during the washing of some of our raw materials for particular products . the raw materials are washed in big water tanks during the quality controls of our products. we need to test the expansion capacity of the slabs to m during quality controls the water used comes from underground sources and from public water system. there is no risk of contamination of underground water resources during the release of water from quality control s as our products are free of chemicals and of any potential threats for water resources. our water consumption is really low and is not significant compared to other impacts such as energy. at the moment we monitor our water consumption but this area do es not constitute a focus for improvement for biogrow. biodiversity. in 2012 we decided to plant coco trees near our production sites in order to develop biodiversity around our factories. we have not deteriorated the natural environment around our facto ries to plant these trees. in 2012 biogrow lanka susta inable development report 2013 22 3. 6 of electricity consumption compared to 2011 paper consumption. every year our offices purchase abou t 60 000 sheets of paper. we know that through paper consumption biogrow can modif y its impact on the environment notably t hrough basic changes in our daily behaviours s uch as reducing the number of print documents using more electronic communication and data recording. efforts made on our paper sourcing e. g. paper quality paper from forest stewar dship council fsc certified forests or paper management e. g. paper r ecycling can change our impacts. in 2013 we have launched a study on the opportunity to change our supply of paper towards a share of fsc certified paper. this would give us the assurance that the paper comes from sustainably managed forests and would c onstitute a means to contribute to the protection of biodiversity. we are also working on ways to reduce our paper consumption in our internal and external co mmunications and data recording and increase the quantity of paper being recycled. biogrow lanka sustainable development report 2013 23 transport. we w ork at optimising the transport of our finished products. when possible we use the empty containers coming to our factories from colombo to bring pallets or raw material thus limiting movements of empty containers and reducing our carbon emissions. in 2013 in order to start creating an environmental friendly corporate culture we asked all our employees to integrate this text in their email signature please consider the environment before printing this email we think it is our responsibility to promote responsible behaviours regarding excessive printing of documents disposal of products and p ackaging. in 2013 we started investigating on how our customers are disposing of the cocopeat slabs and the plastic packaging. we would like to make sure that environmental impacts linked to the disposal of packaging are the lowest possible and that our c ustomers have access to recycling systems or environmentally safe disposal systems. in addition we would like to promote the positive environmental aspects of our products compared to other mineral substrates alternatives. recycling. our collaboration w ith our plastic grow bag supplier has resulted in the recycling of the plastic waste coming from the cutting of the bags. each year we send back to our plastic grow bag supplier about 2 tonnes of plastic for recycling thus reducing the use of natural res ources to produce plastics. in addition we cooperate and exchange on sustainable development issues as well as on the implementation of sustainable development projects. biogrow lanka sustainable development report

discrimination free safe and healthy working place with good remune ration and incentives as well as ensuring their long term employment. indeed the pro duction of coco based organic substrates requires some specific skills and our company can be impacted by a high employee turnover. we have a series of incentives to employees. we try to provi de our workers with sufficient training for

relevance whether in value or quantity and are presented in this report curve b items have medium relevance and curve c items have minor relevance. the main items purchased by amilpar are used for medical purposes and may not derive from recycling activities. an opportunity for reusing this type of material is reprocessing which consists of cleaning disinfecting and sterilizing such items in order to ensure their safe use. quality control is performed at all operational phases. despite the limited quantity of items that can be reprocessed in this class of materials amilpar engages previously approved suppliers for this purpose in accordance with the sanitary legislation in force. although not intended for medical use paper is a signi cant material used by amilpar on a daily

maximize the positive aspects of its business as well as minimizing any adverse e ects. its concern about co 2 emissions re ects in a modern eet and the dissemination of knowledge through its events. the company s major impact in this sense are the indirect emissions relating to amil health rescue. accordingly in 2011 amilpar deployed a program for o setting such emissions through the purchase of carbon credits. this process will be completed in the rst six month period of 2013 and will be included in our next report. the company also o sets emissions resulting from its events. although it does not provide transport for its employees and therefore is not directly liable for the emissions resulting from this activity the company understands its role as co liable for and multiplier of good practices. so it stimulates carpooling which resulted in the solidary carpooling project presented during the amil generations olympics. amilpar uses the r22 gas in its cooling systems and its generators are diesel fueled. due to the fact that they are only used in emergencies generators are not a signi cant source of emissions. although so far this type of emission has not been subject to monitoring the company is deploying an important move regarding consumption and impact management and this should be naturally expected to occur in the coming years. we should mention the small impact

the following steps analysis planning implementation computation and evaluation. within the framework of bersay s proprietary communication engineering approach computation currently the fourth stage becomes an integral and integrated element of each of the other stages. the framework of this approach encompasses output e. g. media coverage as well as outcomes related to b usiness objectives purchasing trends perception management etc. in the target demographic and is the foundation in every step of the planning and implementation stages. previous communication performance is analyzed and the measurable performance crite ria of future communication proposals are defined planning stage. using these criteria every detail of the completed communication strategy is computed down to the micro criteria of the proposal. this approach ensures the right strategy the right pla nning and efficient implementation. it adds more communication value to our customers and to the brands.

international committee of public relations consultancies association and ida communication consultancies association its representative in turkey bersay became th e first company in 1999 to recei ve iso 9002 certificate in the communication industry in turkey. in order to actualize its customers business goals bersay strategically plans manag es and applies communication within the framework of

ks to our corporate strength bersay communication consultancy aims to become a leading communications consultancy in turkey by combining a universal understanding of communications with local culture and values in both national and international markets. bersay communication consultancy has been providing services to leading companies in turkey and around the globe for twenty years shaping communications strategies that contribute to their business goals. we create and execute projects as well as develo ping models to evaluate how our communications programs contribute to the business activities of our customers. services 1. consultancy services communication engineering strategic planning and computation communications is one of the most important processes that must be managed by companies brands or people to achieve their goals in today s climate where global and local economic policies competition and consumers are constantly evolving. communication on progress 2010 12 coherent cre ative and consistent communications processes planned and managed with a strategic approach play an unequivocal vital role in establishing a company s image. evaluating and sharing communications projects in terms of expediency and potential contribut ion is critical. at bersay communication consultancy we attach great importance to evaluating improving and sharing communications strategies as well as to the projects that are created as a result. we not only stay abreast of industry developments and innovations but also create evaluation methods that suit the needs of both our current and potential customers based on our 20 years of experience. leadership communication planning are leaders born or made no one knows exactly when this discussion fir st started but there is no doubt that the main objective in leadership communications planning is to establish a corporate image. the word corporation may describe a company a political organization or a small activist group. however those without the proper perspective in searching for a corporate image or identity do not become leaders but directors. so how does one become or be transformed into a leader who doesn t want to move forward without having to constantly circulate their own image or tra nsform it into a walking logo achieving sustainable and positive added value to one s individual and corporate perception shouldering the responsibility without being overwhelmed by it who doesn t want to forge ahead without getting lost in the delicate yet critical balance between action and fact opportunities and possibilities capacity and messages at bersay communication consultancy we correctly analyze the matrix organization of each gap in a wide vector network. we create the right strategies and action plans leaving nothing to chance. investor relations management the perception of investors is an overriding concern in forming a company s market value. how and to what extent the company s performance is communicated to investors is no less important than the performance itself. the company s stock communication on progress 2010 13 performance or mar ket value is directly related to this corporate perception. as a part of investor relations management here at bersay communication consultancy we manage projects to communicate improvements in a company s performance to investors. in doing so we adhere to the principles of coherence and consistency. international projects counseling communications consultancy is a global profession in our interconnected world. with each passing day companies penetrate new markets and meet new targets based on evolving trends and national economies. as is the case in their own domestic markets these companies need to understand and listen to their customers and social partners and to establish and sustain strong relations in these new markets as well. at bersay commun ication consultancy we walk side by side with our clients on their new journeys and prepare global strategic road maps as business partners who intuitively know who they are and what they need. in the preparation of our plans we benefit from the power of ketchum. corporate social responsibility high brand awareness and a corporate image is what everyone wants. however this begs the question what makes us distinct from the competition in an attempt to respond to this question we see that social respon sibility projects are one important starting point as they are in and of themselves a fundamental approach. a company that not only makes profit but also benefits society and can persuade its shareholders that its responsible perspective is a sincere at titude will undoubtedly distinguish itself from the competition and make a lasting contribution to a corporate image. even if a what s in it for me approach may be beneficial to stakeholders such as employees customers suppliers partners and invest ors in the short term brands which achieve the magic touching that reaches the heart create a true distinction in competition with loyal customers confident business partners and dedicated employees. communication on progress 2010 14 2. applied communication solutions media relations the current state of communications tools and information technologies compels both people and companies to establish healthy and sustainable relations with the media and to manage these relations appropriately. today scores of facts press releases and news items are sent to media organizations by various institutions and public relations agencies making it paramount to differentiate which messages are communicated to the media in this communication chaos. therefore bersay communication consultancy defines media relations strategies parallel to communications strategies prepares media plans based on corporate agenda in line with created strategies and coordinates relations between the company and the media according to a media plan as a result messages are conveyed by corporate spokespeople to their target groups and social partners efficiently and on time in line with a strategic communications approach designed to achieve the company s communications goals in keeping with its business goals. marketing communication as a result of a shrinking global economy companies need marketing focused solutions in their communications projects with strategies aimed at building up their market shares and strategic planning focused on hot sales in additio n to advancing their market values this is marketing communications. previously described as advertising public relations promotion and personal sales today marketing communications encompasses a much wider concept ranging from a product s character istics and packaging to sales and after sales service. communication on progress 2010 15 at bersay communication consultancy we characterize marketing communications as determining a company s communications goals and long term core activities to include allocating the necessary resource s to accomplish these goals and to focus on these activities. to sum up we evaluate the marketing communications opportunities of our customers and develop alternative strategies in line with their goals and offer marketing communications consultancy in both product benefit and positioning strategies. issue management issues emanating from a crisis could do irreparable harm to a company s corporate image financial assets and relations with target groups and social partners. to avoid permanent damage to a company s corporate image a crisis must be managed rapidly with no room for failure. of course sometimes a crisis is unpr edictable mainly because a situation which is susceptible to crisis have not been managed properly and proactively. issue management is one of the tools in communications planning that helps foresee and manage these situations to stave off a crisis in the making. however issue management modules are deployed not only to avo id a possible crisis but to place these on the company s agenda as issues of medium and long term concern and to shape public opinion so that it supports corporate perception. crisis communications without a doubt the most efficient way to manage a crisi s is to predict and solve the crisis before it happens. however this is not always possible. at bersay communication consultancy as a part of our crisis management services we prepare alternative scenarios and action plans based on a customer s areas of potential crisis. we offer consultancy services and application projects to provide a rapid assessment of the extent of the damage caused by the crisis. we work with the communication on progress 2010 16 company s crisis management team to implement action plans and to constantly contro l and communicate the most accurate information to their stakeholders through the best channels. sponsorship projects communication with billions of dollars being spent in this area around the globe sponsorship is an important marketing technique and whe n used efficiently improves product perception. moreover sponsorship projects are highly efficient communications tools in conveying messages to the right stakeholders through the right channels and in creating targets for corporate perception. at bersay communication consultancy we believe that conducting sponsorship projects without proper communications is simply throwing away good money. to us it s of great importance that companies sponsor the right projects in areas that support their communication s goals making the most of these projects as part of their communications strategies. in this respect we either help our customers develop the right proposals for projects that add value to their communications activities or help them manage current spon sorships to reap the highest roi in communications. internal communications at bersay communication consultancy we contend that internal communications is one of the most important pillars supporting a corporate image. communications with employees is a key factor in increasing the quality of a service or a product thus gaining customer satisfaction. every research study on perception invariably reaches the same conclusion the most secure information resource for public opinion and stakeholders is co rporate employees. once you are properly managing your own internal communications as your most important information source then you ll have a communications army at practically no cost. let s use an example to bring home the point think of a company that has 3 000 employees. predictably 3 000 people contact at least 10 people each or 30 000 people who each contact four people in the second layer of the chain or 120 000 total people your communications army an army that has a communication on progress 2010 17 direct and powerful i mpact on your company s business of communicating messages directly to your target groups. at bersay communication consultancy we structure our internal communications services to improve a company s employee satisfaction employees who are dedicated an d efficient with intellectual added value. event management we define all activities organized by our clients as events that include launches press conferences road shows dealer meetings and exhibitions. before we settle on how we first decide whether the event is even appropriate. we do this with our clients. then we ask how do we do this at that point our event management services come into play. what we mean by event management is the planning and management of all processes before during and a fter an event. these processes are many and varied concept development project design budgeting design supply planning production management and information sharing. if we are not directly responsible for organizing an event we provide coordinat ion with third parties and the necessary quality control as well as helping the company reach their primary goal. financial communications services a company s performance indicators include market value profitability efficiency the market share of bo th the product and the company production growth new investments exports their added value to the economy and the workforce they create and profitability from scale economies just to name a few. bersay consultancy s financial communications looks at these indicators as clues to a company s future and current standing. we help our customers position their companies in terms of accountability and sustainability even when they have no intention of going public or of selling blocks of shares. communication on progress 2010 18 3. online communications consultancy the debate regarding how social media communities or online networks the fastest growing new communications platforms have increasingly become more important for companies and their brands is still raging. however serious confusion exists over the dynamics of these online networks and corporate brand positioning. at this point the attitudes of many companies influence the perception that online communications is all about digital marketing projects. however bersay consul tancy is committed to managing corporate and brand perceptions not only through strategic planning but through online networks. we have adopted the listen join produce approach which is essential to establishing and maintaining a presence in online n etworks and especially in the social media. thus we first listen to and follow what s talked about all around us regarding companies and brands and of course their main competitors. we conduct detailed analysis and reporting on this data and create stra tegies based on these analyses. we develop and implement projects based on these strategies to improve perception in these networks. in this sense we offer our customers the most proper and efficient way for a company to manage their relations with opini on leaders in the social media. moreover we evaluate sponsorship projects that we believe will contribute to a brand s communications. we also evaluate cooperation opportunities resulting from a company s extended online presence. in other words we eval uate and design projects to complement a customer s strategic approach. communication on

september 2013 to our stakeholders i am pleased to confirm that van gansewinkel groep reaffirms its support of the ten principles of the united nations global compact in the areas of human rights labour environment and anti corruption. in this annual communication on progress we descri be our actions to continually improve the integration of the global compact and its principle s into our business strategy culture and daily operations. we also commit to share this informatio n with our stakeholders using our primary channels of communication. sincerely yours cees van gent ceo van gansewinkel human rights assessment policy and goals description of the relevance of human rights for th e company i. e. human rights risk assessment. description of policies public commitments and com pany goals on human rights. code of conduct it is van gansewinkel s firm belief that it is impo ssible to create value without respecting values. i n everything we do we seek to comply with applicable laws and regulations to make our compliance visible and transparent and to go about our busines s with integrity. that is why our policy principles and core values and the principles of the un global compact serve as the point of departure for how we want all our people to conduct themselves. this is how we safeguard our standards and values for our employees our customers our suppliers our sh areholders and the world around us. in 2012 the 2011 draft of the code was updated in collaboration and accordance with the central works council describing our organisation business integrity responsibilities of the company responsibilities of the employees the codes sets out important elements of desired in tegrity and also contains the company s underlying policy principles in which full referen ce is made to the 10 principals of the un global compact. policy principles to realise growth for the company and its employee s to bring about intensive and innovative cooperatio n with customers in order to provide the best possible service to supply raw materials and fuels as a second life for all waste products to contribute to a sustainable development of soci ety to take social responsibility core values putting the customer first we are involved genuinely interested and customer oriented progressive our vision is waste no more. partnership and trust we guarantee integrity and transparency in the proc essing of material streams prioritising safety we want everyone who works for us to be able to go home healthy and well promoting competence and expertise we encourage personal growth and collaboration implementation description of concrete actions to implement human rights policies address human rights risks and respond to human rights violations. integrity in 2012 the 2011 draft code of conduct was updated. since 2010 we also have been working actively to give shape and substance to the theme of integri ty. besides a corporate integrity manager we have local integrity contacts in place. furthermore we have a specific communication path for integrity related investigations and a complaints procedure f or the manner in which integrity investigations are conducted. our integrity investigations registration system be came operational in 2012. this management system is part of our reporting system trackwise. m oreover we worked on further developing training sessions and workshops dealing with integrity and o rganised a number of such sessions and workshops. furthermore van gansewinkel s integrity manager participated in the annual integrity experts meeting a joint initiative in which variou s national parties are presented for example the ministry of justice the tax and customs administra tion the police the employee insurance agency the ministry of the interior courts the immigrati on and naturalisation service as well as commercia l operators such as ing bank rabobank klm akzo nob el shell dsm holland casino and ahold. the purpose is to exchange not only know how and ex pertise but also instruments with concrete applications in order to achieve a higher level of integrity within each of the separate organisations. the coming period will be used to help staff and ma nagement learn to view integrity and a regular process one that is not controlled purely by proto cols. risk management will be part of this. many of these kinds of issues whether they are about integ rity of the workforce use of social media or eliminating aggression and violence will be addres sed during training sessions workshops and in advice. sustainable supply chain management van gansewinkel has a formal monitoring process in place of the supply chain. we explicitly includes sustainable development as a factor when selecting and assessing processing businesses and increasingly suppliers. this hinges on demonstrabl e compliance with requirements laid down in laws and regulations mutual arrangements and care for t he supply chain. in 2012 we continued our efforts to centralise and standardise our records of processing businesses in a central database and to give shape to monitori ng the integrity of the data entered. we assess processing businesses and suppliers based on risk p rofiles that we draw up of our partners. they are audited by van gansewinkel employees trained specif ically for that job. the results are recorded in a specially designed section of our management system. measurement of outcomes description of how the company monitors and evaluat es performance. integrity in 2012 we received 21 integrity reports. some of this year s reports again came from within the organisation while others were made by individuals and institutions outside the organisation. the reports concerned two instances of aggression and v iolence internal nine instances of crime primarily theft two instances of fraud five ins tances of improper use of company assets of which five reports were in relation to illegal waste coll ection either paid or unpaid one instance of imp roper use of confidential information and a report of two armed robberies at a van gansewinkel site. of the 21 reports 19 were taken under investigatio n and two were reclassified as integrity advice and as such were designated as not requiring investigat ion. three investigations are still ongoing in 2013 and two investigations were started in january 2013. we are working with the police in our investigations of the armed robberies and one insta nce of internal fraud. these criminal investigation s had not been completed by the end of 2012. several instances resulted in reports being filed with the police and in some cases criminal investigations w ere conducted. involvement in integrity infringements led to 12 employees being dismissed. a worker on secondment with van gansewinkel was relieved of his duties and summarily dismissed by his employer in connection with fraud committed at van gansewinkel. advisory reports were issued on 38 occasions during 2012. the subjects of those advisory reports vary ranging from stalking security narcotics a ssistance with criminal investigations tackling ve hicle related crime and false identity ict fraud theft and phantom invoices. particularly during the final quarter of the year van gansewinkel received numerous phantom invoices as they are known from various countries. in response we worked on alertness to fraud detection and handling either internally or by the judiciary. naturally this enabled us to prevent various payments from being made. van gansewinkel did not receive any complaints abou t violations of human rights in 2012. sustainable supply chain management depending on the score processing businesses will be assigned a high medium low risk profile. the criteria are the type of waste processed the busin ess s situation with regard to permits the system certificates achieved whether or not the business processes cross border waste and the country of final processing business. depending on the risk pr ofile we might assess additional or fewer details relating to compliance with laws and regulations. n egative reports about our partners also give us cause to take additional steps or to assign a highe r risk profile to particular businesses. in 2011 we commenced work on a methodology for sele cting and assessing critical suppliers. that methodology is an extension of the methods used for processing businesses. suppliers are initially assessed based on their impact on our primary proce ss on the risk they pose for our image and on revenue. a series of checklists is used to assign e ach supplier a level per separate theme. themes considered in this connection include compliance wi th laws and regulations orderliness and neatness safety care system quality of processes and produ cts and social themes. these themes are compared with the guidelines set out in the un glob al compact. the group audits its critical suppliers at least once every three years. five audits were c onducted last year. scores of good were awarded for two of those audits with two others scoring s atisfactory. the score for one audit was initially unsatisfactory. however after adjustments were m ade the status of good was as yet awarded. labour assessment policy and goals description of the relevance of labour rights for t he company i. e. labour rights related risks and opportunities. description of written policies pu blic commitments and company goals on labour rights. in 2012 the 2011 draft of the code was updated in c ollaboration and accordance with the central works council describing our organisation business integrity responsibilities of the company responsibilities of the employees the codes sets out important elements of desired in tegrity and also contains the company s underlying policy principles in which full referen ce is made to the 10 principals of the un global compact. implementation description of concrete actions taken by the compan y to implement labour policies address labour risks and respond to labour violations. employee participation van gansewinkel groep encourages employee participa tion and for that purpose actively seeks out the dialogue with its employees and representatives employee participation councils. we believe that cooperation with those councils and unions is an im portant factor in realising our mutual goals. employee participation at our group is given shape where the actual activities take place in the businesses. as such almost every division has its own works council. group works councils for collection recycling and processing also exist as well as a central works council. each works council has formed a shwe safety health welfare and environment committee as required by the dutch working conditions act arbowet. in all 118 and 39 workers respectively were active in the various dutch and belgian works councils. collective employment agreement over 90 of van gansewinkel groep s employees are s ubject to a collective employment agreement or other form of collective scheme. under the colle ctive employment agreements salaries are based on the pay grades for specific jobs. as such no me asurable difference exists between the salaries of male and female workers. the collective employment agreements for professional goods transport by road beroepsgoederenvervoer over de weg wenb waste environment sector metalworking industry metaalnijverheid and orsima are in force in the netherlands. in belgium indirect workers have what is commonly known as collective insurance. direct workers fall under three joint committees pc 226 transport logistics pc 121 c leaning en pc 142 recovery of materials. these include pension schemes and early retirement scheme s. in the czech republic two subsidiaries tempos a. s. and van gansewinkel services sro have collective employment agreements. the other employees like those in poland have individual co ntracts that are based on internal regulations and prevailing laws and regulations. there too no dis tinction is made between men and women. the conditions for permanent employees such as insuran ce healthcare and leave entitlement also apply to temporary workers. health and safety following its introduction in 2007 and its concrete implementation at the various regions and businesses of the group the injury frequency rate dropped annually by more than 20 until the end of 2011. in 2012 the injury frequency and severity ra te rose slightly. nevertheless the figures remaine d low compared with the sector average results. for t he third consecutive year we did not experience any fatal incidents. the lost time injuries 109 in all mostly concerne d bruises sprains and cuts. the victims of those incidents were men on 105 occasions and women in 4 other instances. regrettably 25 serious incidents occurred one involving a female victim. those incidents involved broken bones and amputations. in 2 cases the victims lost parts of f ingers. the most serious incident involved a dutch employee being struck by a role of paper breaking 12 ribs and damaging 2 vertebrae in his neck. the employee eventually made a full recovery from his i njuries. van gansewinkel records all incidents and hazardous situations in trackwise. we use this system to analyse and follow up on reports from within the or ganisation. the causes actions and lessons learned are communicated internally to draw contin ual attention to safety and to increase awareness. we also teach our external workers about safety and provide them with relevant basic training. our efforts in this respect are successful compared wi th 2011 the injury frequency rate for temporary workers improved by 80. nevertheless the injury f requency rate for temporary workers was 14 higher than among our own employees 9. 3 compared w ith 8. 0 in 2012. prevention to help reduce the number of incidents further van gansewinkel places an emphasis on reporting unsafe actions and hazardous situations the near misses. this means that we are mapping out the underlying layers of the accident pyramid more care fully as well. to this end we report all incidents for example incidents leading to different work or hosp italisation and first aid incidents in a clear cut manner. these reports enable management to respond even better to near misses and help to prevent those near misses from becoming incidents. targets have been defined for several of the incide nt categories identified. this shows whether our accident pyramid is a healthy one. the results fo r 2012 were as follows the number of total recordable cases compared with the number of lost time injuries 3. 1 with a target of 3 the number of first aid cases compared with the nu mber of lost time injuries 5. 5 with a target of 10 the number of near misses compared with the number of lost time injuries 51. 7 with a target of 50 these results show that the numbers reported for re cordables and near misses are higher than the targets defined. only first aid incidents remain un der reported. as such we will launch a series of initiatives locally to ensure better reporting of f irst aid incidents. the reporting of near misses im proved further and exceeded the target thanks to a series of initiatives aimed at making reporting easier. absence for van gansewinkel s total workforce the absence rate percentage was 5. 0 in 2012. we hope to bring this percentage down to 4. 9 in 2013. the fre quency with which employees called in sick last year was 1. 9. awareness raising integrity in 2012 the 2011 draft code of conduct was updated. since 2010 we also have been working actively to give shape and substance to the theme of integri ty. besides a corporate integrity manager we have local integrity contacts in place. furthermore we have a specific communication path for integrity related investigations and a complaints procedure f or the manner in which integrity investigations are conducted. moreover we worked on further developin g training sessions and workshops dealing with integrity and organised a number of such sessions a nd workshops. furthermore van gansewinkel s integrity manager participated in the annual integr ity experts meeting a joint initiative in which va rious national parties are presented. the purpose is to e xchange not only know how and expertise but also instruments with concrete applications in order to achieve a higher level of integrity within each of the separate organisations. the coming period will be used to help staff and ma nagement learn to view integrity and a regular process one that is not controlled purely by proto cols. risk management will be part of this. many of these kinds of issues whether they are about integ rity of the workforce use of social media or eliminating aggression and violence will be addres sed during training sessions workshops and in advice. measurement of outcomes description of how the company monitors and evaluat es performance. measurement of results every two years van gansewinkel groep conducts an e mployee motivation survey ems. the surveys show how the company manifests itself in ev er changing circumstances and provides information about areas that require more adjustmen t. van gansewinkel groep s next ems was scheduled to t ake place in december 2012. that was a turbulent time however it was just then that we p resented the plans for improvement and announced which employees would be made redundant as a result of the restructuring. because of these extraordinary developments we decided to shift the ems to 2013. an important principle is that the survey be conducted in a stable situation some tim e after the new organisation has been given shape. we expect that by doing so we can make a rel iable comparison with previous years findings. however the managing boards of various divisions a nd regions of van gansewinkel groep managed to finalise the plans for improvement in 2012 that had been drawn up with input from the local works councils based on the most recent ems. the plans we re based on the centrally defined priorities 1 organisation 2 opportunities for development and 3 working conditions. we informed our staff about some of these initiatives using publications in our regular internal media. the following are some examples of local improvemen ts based on the group s most recent ems 1. better information at van gansewinkel minerals employees of van gansewinkel minerals wanted to be kept informed better. several actions were implemented during the year including a decision t o increase the frequency of the local staff magazine changes to consultation structures and in vestments in training and education. 2. formation of ems project teams for each site and in formation sessions at van gansewinkel south to better structure the follow up to the findings r esulting from the ems van gansewinkel s southern region formed separate project teams at ea ch of its sites. those teams included drivers loaders planners order processers service desk s taff and garage staff. even management joined in. the purpose of the teams is to serve as an appr oachable point of contact for staff and to periodically discuss the status of the plans for im provement one of the aims being to improve communication between separate departments and the provision of information to the people on the work floor. for example the region organised a series of information sessions to structurally feed the basic knowledge of sales staff and to put forward ideas for better customer retention. 3. call for and implementation of new ideas at van gan sewinkel north the wishes and complaints of the people on the work floor particularly at operations were not reaching management properly. in response van gans ewinkel s northern region set up the project the best idea of. all operations employee s were asked to put forward ideas for safety engagement and customer focus. this call produced 4 00 ideas which were then judged in terms of originality and practical and economic feasibili ty. five ideas were rewarded with prizes which were handed out during a special evening event. the ideas have currently been implemented or are in the process of being implemented. 4. tackling problem areas using the tree of goals at the financial shared service centre at the financial shared service centre fssc a pr oject group investigated possibilities for further improving employee satisfaction. a list was drawn up of everything that was causing difficulties. those findings were organised into a tree of problems to show the causes and connections. this was then taken as the basis for c reating a tree of goals to eliminate the problems identified and bring about improvements on e step at a time. all actions that had been agreed upon were realised in 2012. a new workgroup will update the tree of goals and see what areas still require further measures. van gansewinkel will continue to use emss as contro l tools. the surveys serve as a driver for implementing improvements and emphasise the importa nce of happy employees and management s responsibility in that connection. male female diversity van gansewinkel had operations in nine european c ountries in 2012. the workforce increased from 6 027 to 6 226 employees not including temporary w orkers. besides the 6 226 employees an average of 1 069 ftes from temporary employment age ncies worked for the company over the course of the year. the company had 5 138 male employees and 1 088 fema le employees with fixed term or permanent employment contracts. the corresponding figures for 2011 were 4 967 men and 1 060 women. this means that the shift in the proportions during 2012 was marginal. male female diversity in management management members of the board of directors dire ctors of the central support departments and regional management teams of van gansewinkel groep comprises mostly men. the group of staff reporting directly to members of the board of direc tors is made up entirely of 19 men. the top 200 as it is commonly known consisted of 174 employees 149 men and 25 women. staff turnover the number of employees no longer working for van g ansewinkel divided by the number of employees at year end represents staff turnover. in 2012 this figure was 11. 6 compared with 10. 6 in the previous year. staff turnover appears to hav e risen only slightly despite the restructuring th at began at the end of the year this is because the n umerical effects of the staff cutbacks begin in 201 3. as such staff turnover for 2013 is expected to be higher than in 2012. collective employment agreement over 90 of van gansewinkel groep s employees are s ubject to a collective employment agreement or other form of collective scheme. under the colle ctive employment agreements salaries are based on the pay grades for specific jobs. as such no me asurable difference exists between the salaries of male and female workers. the collective employment agreements for professional goods transport by road beroepsgoederenvervoer over de weg wenb waste environment sector metalworking industry metaalnijverheid and orsima are in force in the

agreements. the other employees like those in poland have individual co ntracts that are based on internal regulations and prevailing laws and regulations. there too no dis tinction is made between men and women. the conditions for permanent employees such as insuran ce healthcare and leave entitlement also apply to temporary workers. suppliers van gansewinkel audits its critical suppliers at le ast once every three years. five audits were conducted last year. scores of good were awarded for two of those audits with two others scoring satisfactory. the score for one audit was initial ly unsatisfactory. however after adjustments wer e made the status of good was as yet awarded. information and management systems because every incident is one too many incidents a nd dangerous situations are recorded in trackwise. those records are used for analysis and follow up within the organisation. the causes actions and lessons learned are communicated throug hout the organisation to draw continual attention to safety and to increase awareness. van gansewinkel groep has set up environmental mana gement systems at all its critical businesses and locations. this means that potential hazards f or example fire have been identified the risks an d impact calculated and appropriate control measures put in place. each operational entity has trained staff and has built suitable checks into the proces s of acceptance and processing. no corners are cut with investments aimed at supporting these control measures. if an incident as yet occurs the emergency plans will be put into action. our organi sation s readiness is tested regularly by means of training sessions. the company adopts a proactive c entral crisis communication policy in the case of incidents. independent verification of management systems van gansewinkel groep s management systems are audi ted and certified by bureau veritas certification. the regular audit team is involved i n periodic meetings and training sessions in order to continually improve the depth of the external audit s. in 2012 special emphasis was placed on verifyin g the extent to which our activities are compliant. the external audits conducted in 2012 196. 5 audit days for the whole group resulted in 129 non compliance reports ncrs of which 19 majors and 110 minors. these figures are virtually unchanged compared with 2011 130 ncrs despite th e increase in the number of certificates particularly ohsas 18001. the three most frequent ncrs concerned the followin g elements or non compliance therewith production realisation 39 ncrs measurement and monitoring 27 ncrs risk management 13 ncrs. the separate units are required to remedy all these ncrs within three months and the remedies must be accepted by bureau veritas certification. to dat e we have succeeded in doing so. the final outstanding actions will be completed early in 2013. compliance last year we paid a total of ten material penaltie s sanctions of more than 500 for non compliance with laws and regulations. two instances concerned non compliance with the dutch working conditions act arbowet two instances involved vi olations of adr regulations transport of hazardous goods one instance concerned an overload of a veh icle and one instance concerned a vehicle with an excessive height. the competent authorities also imposed four orders for incremental penalties for non observance of the maximum transfer capacity un der the relevant permit. a penalty of 1 500 was imposed two instances of storing a container in locations for which no permit had been issued. a total penalty of 4 000 was imposed non compliance with regulations under the dutch ma jor accidents risks decree besluit risico s zware ongevallen. a penalty of 25 000 was imposed. the total penalty was 48 250. we will continue to monitor claims that are still being processed and will report on them in a later sustainability repor t once they have been finalised. integrity in 2012 we received 21 integrity reports. some of this year s reports again came from within the organisation while others were made by individuals and institutions outside the organisation. the reports concerned two instances of aggression and v iolence internal nine instances of crime primarily theft two instances of fraud five ins tances of improper use of company assets of which five reports were in relation to illegal waste coll ection either paid or unpaid one instance of imp roper use of confidential information and a report of two armed robberies at a van gansewinkel site. of the 21 reports 19 were taken under investigatio n and two were reclassified as integrity advice and as such were designated as not requiring investigat ion. three investigations are still ongoing in 2013 and two investigations were started in january 2013. we are working with the police in our investigations of the armed robberies and one insta nce of internal fraud. these criminal investigation s had not been completed by the end of 2012. several instances resulted in reports being filed with the police and in some cases criminal investigations w ere conducted. involvement in integrity infringements led to 12 employees being dismissed. a worker on secondment with van gansewinkel was relieved of his duties and summarily dismissed by his employer in connection with fraud committed at van gansewinkel. advisory reports were issued on 38 occasions during 2012. the subjects of those advisory reports vary ranging from stalking security narcotics a ssistance with criminal investigations tackling ve hicle related crime and false identity ict fraud theft and phantom invoices. van gansewinkel did not receive any complaints abou t violations of human rights in 2012. environment assessment policy and goals description of the relevance of environmental prote ction for the company i. e. environmental risks and opportunities. description of policies public com mitments and company goals on environmental protection. the global scarcity of raw materials forms the basi s for our strategy. as a raw material and energy supplier van gansewinkel can make a significant con tribution to fighting raw material scarcity and global warming. together with customers and other s takeholders recycling and waste prevention can help keep natural raw materials in the environment. and in nearly every instance recycling leads to co 2 reduction. in 2012 79 of the waste was given a second life b y being used as a raw material or being usefully applied as green energy. by giving 57. 8 of the was te a second life in the form of raw materials or building materials van gansewinkel prevented the e mission of 1. 38 million tons of co 2 in the chain. the second life percentage fell just short of the a mbition expressed last year. the co 2 emissions prevented in the whole chain slightly exceeded the ambition expressed last year. van gansewinkel succeeded in recycling even greater volumes than in previous years particularly at coolrec and maltha our recycling businesses where our efforts are improving year after year and where the volumes of plastic and glass recycled als o rose significantly. at the same time we processed larger volumes of waste in categories for which we have good thermal solutions for example combustible waste. this has a downward effe ct on the reuse percentages. for 2012 the shift in waste flows caused a slight increase in the seco nd life percentage compared with the adjusted percentage for 2011 and in an increase in the co 2 emissions prevented. for 2013 too the explicit focus of our ambitions is to give a second life to as many materials as possible. however the relative proportion of combu stible waste with a low second life percentage is on the rise whereas the volume of construction and demolition waste for example which possesses a high second life percentage is diminishing because of the poor economy. in view of these shifting waste flows we expect that the second life percent age will drop slightly during the coming year. the forecast for 2013 is that we will be able to conver t at least 57. 5 of our waste into raw materials or building materials. combined with our green energy production this will prevent 1. 30 million tons of co 2 emissions in the chain. van gansewinkel groep works together with customers and partners to develop new concepts tools and techniques to give more and more waste a second life in the form of raw materials. this helps us give shape to our goal of waste continues to be a raw material and to contribute to solving the problem of scarce raw materials. finding a higher q uality processing method is an essential step in th e right direction. last year we worked together with our partners to develop more sustainable solutions for waste issues. despite our focus on the restructuring we got started on this for example with the following projects post collection separation of household waste the introduction of the new packing materials agree ment in 2013 means that municipal authorities have two options separation at the source and post collection separation. separation at the source is more difficult to realise in highly urban ised areas making post collection separation a better alternative to ensure that as much waste as possible can be given a second life. van gansewinkel groep is researching the technical and economic feasibility. waste collection using the basic bin van gansewinkel public services and the municipalit y of krimpen aan den ijssel have adopted a new method of collecting waste. the basic bin basi sbak can be used for depositing not only paper and paperboard but also other dry materials such as plastic clothes ceramics and small electrical appliances. until mid 2013 we will be t esting whether this manner of collection works and whether it can be used on a larger scale. recovery of neodymium from hard disk drives electronic waste contains many scarce earth metals including neodymium in the magnets of hard disk drives. van gansewinkel is working with delft university of technology and m2i to investigate whether it is technically and economically feasible to recover this material using high quality methods allowing it to be reused in hybrid cars f or example or for generating sustainable energy. recycling of valuable metals from electrical applia nces and electronics a major challenge in our efforts to recycle electro nics is recovering scarce and costly precious metals such as gold silver copper tin and nickel. that is why van gansewinkel groep working in close partnership with m2i has developed a new tec hnique on a laboratory scale for separating those metals using wet chemical processes. the grea t advantages are fewer emissions lower energy consumption and a higher percentage of mater ial that can be reused. we will continue to work with m2i and delft university of technology to further develop this process to the point where industrial application is possible. transformation of polluted filter cake into buildin g materials polluted filter cake a residue remaining after cer tain production processes is often dumped in landfills. van gansewinkel groep has now developed a processing method for a customer to transform this residue into a building material for the civil engineering sector and the concrete and cement industry. rockcycle a return system for rock wool residue rockwool and van gansewinkel have developed europe s first return system for rock wool residue rockcycle. van gansewinkel collects the rock wool residue from rockwool s customers and transports the material to a rockwool recycling plant where the rock wool residue is compressed into briquettes after which it can be r eused as a raw material in the production of new rock wool. as a result new products can contai n up to 50 recycled materials. reuse of old roofing materials bitumen is a petroleum product that is used in roof ing materials among other things. at present bituminous roofing waste is very rarely recycled. u sing recycled bitumen will help reduce co 2 and balance cycles. for van gansewinkel groep this is sufficient reason to work together with several of its customers to reuse old bituminous roofing ma terial as a raw material in new roofing materials rather than as fuel. recovery of synthetic fibre in close partnership with a major chemical company van gansewinkel groep has conceived a method for recycling synthetic fibre instead of inc inerating it. this type of fibre is very strong and is used for an increasing number of applications incl uding high quality fabrics for gloves clothing particularly bullet resistant items and vehicles. the chemical company hopes to start offering this solution to its customers worldwide. cradle to cradle work wear van gansewinkel groep teamed up with industrial clo thing manufacturer van puijenbroek textiel and textile service providers berendsen and lavans to bring rework onto the market cradle to cradle certified industrial clothing designed in such a manner that each element can be reused. old work clothing is used to spin new thread or mak e compost. the waste specialists at van gansewinkel ecosmart have also been wearing cradle to cradle certified outfits since march 2012. these clothes were developed in partnership w ith fashion label dutchspirit based on returnity a fully recyclable synthetic fibre. wo rk clothes that are torn or worn out are taken back and reused in new materials. tree soil in partnership with van helvoirt groenprojecten va n gansewinkel has developed a sustainable tree soil made from 100 recycled materials. the tr ee soil given the name tree terra has been awarded cradle to cradle certification. tree s oil serves as a stable basis for paved areas and as a source of nutrition for trees. traditional ly the tree soil that is used in the netherland contains at least 67 excavated sand. for producing tree terra a csp ceramic stone porcelain fraction is used a waste flow that is r eleased in maltha s recycling process. sustainable method of processing temporary construc tion van gansewinkel has entered into a long term partne rship agreement with jarino groep in assen to retrieve temporary and semi permanent buildings from the market. the waste flows that are released when breaking down and dismantling the bui ldings will be processed using sustainable methods. the resulting raw materials will be return ed to suppliers of jarino and other companies. in 2013 we will give even more explicit shape to o ur sustainable vision of waste no more. to that end we have formed a business development departme nt to accelerate innovation both in the short term and in the long term and to further improve ou r performance in high quality recycling techniques. co2 emission prevented in the chain van gansewinkel groep uses energy in its efforts to convert waste materials into raw materials and energy. this automatically means that we emit co 2. however the output of raw materials such as glass metals plastics and wood leads to consider ably lower co 2 emissions in the manufacture of new products. it costs less energy to recover such secondary raw materials than to incinerate them and extract and process new primary raw materials. in 2012 van gansewinkel groep prevented 1. 38 million tons of co 2 emissions in the chain. this represents 5. 0 of th e dutch target according to the european climate policy for reducing co 2 emissions by 20 by 2020 compared with 1990. as su ch while increasing our own efforts to convert waste i nto raw materials will cause our own co 2 emissions to increase it will also lead to a consi derable reduction in the overall co 2 emissions in the chain. van gansewinkel groep believes that improvin g the second life percentage is a more important goal than reducing co 2 emissions in the whole chain. environmental and reputation risks as a waste service provider and supplier of raw mat erials and energy van gansewinkel operates in the environmental sector. parties operating in this sector are exposed to risks associated with incidents that have an adverse impact on the enviro nment and that give rise to costs for remedying the situation. incidents might also have a negative eff ect on van gansewinkel s reputation and good name. van gansewinkel has set up environmental mana gement systems at all its critical businesses and locations. this means that potential hazards f or example fire have been identified the risks an d impact calculated and appropriate control measures put in place. each operational entity has trained staff and has built suitable checks into the proces s of acceptance and processing. no corners are cut with investments aimed at supporting these control measures. if an incident as yet occurs the emergency plans will be put into action. our organi sation s readiness is tested regularly. the company adopts a proactive central crisis communication pol icy in the case of incidents. implementation description of concrete actions to implement enviro nmental policies address environmental risks and respond to environmental incidents. awareness raising in 2012 we again accepted various invitations to gi ve presentations and we participated in discussions and dialogues of others. the following are some exa mples multicopy internal multicopy event for shop owne rs about cradle to cradle unilever meeting of the unilever sustainability group about

follow up processes in separate areas. for exam ple it allows us to continually contribute to and help drive the discussion concerning the concept of a circular economy and yields valuable input for improving our annual report. theme supply chain responsibility in dialogue with partners in 2012 van gansewinkel minerals organised three s eparate breakfast workshops for engineering firms property developers and architects at the rd m campus in rotterdam revolving around the theme of improving the sustainability of building materials. the construction industry is a sector where our understanding of mineral materials and re cycling techniques can make a particularly significant contribution in bringing materials into the cycle. based on past experiences however we know that we still face a number of challenges in t erms of concrete use of alternative and sustainable building materials in the construction sector. for example tendering procedures do not always offer scope for non conventional raw materials for constr uction and the established operators in the construction chain have proved to be somewhat conse rvative. the participants at the sessions therefore discussed how to make sustainable innovat ion in the construction chain a viable possibility. some of the conclusions are summarised below measuring non conventional building materials to increase the visibility of sustainability in the construction industry the engineering firms emphasised the importance of providing principals w ith the proper evidence and advising them for example by highlighting improved features demonstr ating the gains for the environment and offering secondary materials at competitive prices. cooperating as colleagues and partners in the const ruction chain engineering firms property developers and architec ts consider cooperation as colleagues and partners in the construction chain to be the most i mportant vehicle for rapidly improving the sustainability of building materials. topics put fo rward in this connection include adding sustainable building materials to the national envi ronmental database setting up a joint display garden and initiating a joint lobby for non convent ional materials. simplifying the cycle the economic crisis means that the future is not in new development but rather in the way in which old buildings and materials can be reused. pr operty developers explained that ideally those materials should be reusable in the same plac es. their advice to keep it on the spot advocates a simplification of the cycle and as such an increased possibility of reuse. gearing designs to shorter construction times and e nsuring knowledge transfer at present buildings are designed to last 50 to 10 0 years. by gearing the designs to shorter construction times the principal has to deal with every phase of the building cycle. this requires comprehensive construction from design until the e nd of the building s life. it is vital to possess the appropriate understanding of sustainable buildi ng materials. architects explained that they required information about secondary materials pro of of sustainability and concrete demonstration materials samples. the sessions on sustainability in the construction chain will be continued in 2013 and will be aimed at municipal and provincial authorities. theme raw materials scarcity in dialogue with the children s council more than two years ago van gansewinkel groep star ted a partnership with the missing chapter foundation of princess laurentien van oranje. that non profit organisation brings today s decision makers into contact with children s refreshing and candid ideas about strategic dilemmas surrounding sustainability. under the name of raad van kindere n children s council the foundation links primary schools to businesses. van gansewinkel groe p also has its own children s council the 8 th montessori school zeeburg in amsterdam. we continue d our discussions with them about our vision of waste no more in 2012. after a waste workshop which was preceded by a g uided tour at van gansewinkel the children s council presented their ideas to members of our com pany s management team in the nemo science centre in amsterdam. at that meeting the children explained their views on the question of how van gansewinkel can ensure that manufacturers use clea ner methods to make their products and in what way consumers can separate more waste to give as mu ch waste as possible a second life in the form of raw materials. the dialogue session showed that the children also consider waste to be an important theme. they also feel that it is partly their responsibility to change habits at home. children are often drivers for new ideas and can act as positive change agents in thei r families. the following are some of the ideas that were put f orward by the children s council to include labels on products and containers expla ining in which bin they belong which will make waste separation more accurate but above all fun visible and easy not to hide waste containers but instead to make them attractive striking and sexier to make it simpler and more fun to throw out waste to develop a waste app that shows where to find th e nearest container when you are out and about to use a new credo of paper belongs with paper. p lastic belongs with plastic. glass belongs with glass. friends want to hang out together. to encou rage other children in the vicinity to collect and separate waste. the partnership with the children s council will co ntinue in 2013 and we will consider how to put the various ideas to use. initiatives and programmes to reduce waste material s the global scarcity of raw materials forms the basi s for our strategy. as a raw material and energy supplier van gansewinkel can make a significant con tribution to fighting raw material scarcity and global warming. together with customers and other s takeholders recycling and waste prevention can help keep natural raw materials in the environment. and in nearly every instance recycling leads to co 2 reduction. in 2012 79 of the waste was given a second life b y being used as a raw material or being usefully applied as green energy. by giving 57. 8 of the was te a second life in the form of raw materials or building materials van gansewinkel prevented the e mission of 1. 38 million tons of co 2 in the chain. the second life percentage fell just short of the a mbition expressed last year. the co 2 emissions prevented in the whole chain slightly exceeded the ambition expressed last year. measurement of outcomes description of how the company monitors and evaluat es environmental performance. environmental incidents last year van gansewinkel groep s activities led t o environmental incidents on 362 occasions compared with 296 incidents in 2011. this increase stems from an improved registration of reports particularly with regard to oil leaks. further info rmation has been provided in order to reduce the number of oil leaks in the future. the information mostly focused on preventive maintenance chiefly for hydraulic systems in lorries. of the 362 incidents 155 concerned discharges into the air mostly at our energy from waste plants. most cases involved non observance of emission stan dards for carbon monoxide and flue gas treatment. our process engineers are currently work ing on a number of projects aimed specifically at improvements to reduce those emissions. spills onto the soil occurred on 165 occasions during the year most of which resulted from leakages of some litres of oil. discharges into water occurred on 19 occasions. once this involved a discharge of what s ubsequently proved to be a non toxic chemical substance into the surface water. other types of in cidents occurred on 30 occasions for example excessive levels of dust and odours. in addition f ires occurred 95 times. our own staff was able to p ut out 57 of those fires. the fire services were calle d in on 38 occasions. noticeable damage to equipment or buildings was caused by fire on two oc casions. all environmental incidents are reported and record ed in a central database and the measures to be taken are strictly adhered to in the environmental care system. emissions the principal locations of airborne emissions are t he energy from waste plants in rozenburg and duiven. a number of components in the airborne emis sions are measured continually or semi continually. the measuring equipment has been veri fied and approved and two permit requirements for co emissions and particulate matter were exceed ed significantly. by far the majority of the group s waste water is p roduced by the two energy from waste plants in rozenburg and duiven and the activities of van gans ewinkel minerals. the volume is the same as the average water pollution caused by 4 155 dutch indiv iduals during a year. the waste water from the remaining van gansewinkel groep activities is insig nificant and comprises less than 5 of the volumes listed. biodiversity the location of our sites and the work connected to them mean that our activities have a very minor i f not negligible impact on the biodiversity. earlier inventories showed that a few van gansewinkel groep sites are located near nature conservation ar eas. groundwater is extracted at only three sites where the effects on the surrounding areas are negl igible. none of the environmental permits for any of the sites stipulate restrictions aimed at protec ting natural values that have a measurable influenc e on our operations. information and management systems van gansewinkel groep has set up environmental mana gement systems at all its critical businesses and locations. this means that potential hazards f or example fire have been identified the risks an d impact calculated and appropriate control measures put in place. each operational entity has trained staff and has built suitable checks into the proces s of acceptance and processing. no corners are cut with investments aimed at supporting these control measures. if an incident as yet occurs the emergency plans will be put into action. our organi sation s readiness is tested regularly by means of training sessions. the company adopts a proactive c entral crisis communication policy in the case of incidents. independent verification of management systems van gansewinkel groep s management systems are audi ted and certified by bureau veritas certification. the regular audit team is involved i n periodic meetings and training sessions in order to continually improve the depth of the external audit s. in 2012 special emphasis was placed on verifyin g the extent to which our activities are compliant. the external audits conducted in 2012 196. 5 audit days for the whole group resulted in 129 non compliance reports ncrs of which 19 majors and 110 minors. these figures are virtually unchanged compared with 2011 130 ncrs despite th e increase in the number of certificates particularly ohsas 18001. compliance last year we paid a total of ten material penaltie s sanctions of more than 500 for non compliance with laws and regulations. two instances concerned non compliance with the dutch working conditions act arbowet two instances involved vi olations of adr regulations transport of hazardous goods one instance concerned an overload of a veh icle and one instance concerned a vehicle with an excessive height. the competent authorities also imposed four orders for incremental penalties for non observance of the maximum transfer capacity un der the relevant permit. a penalty of 1 500 was imposed two instances of storing a container in locations for which no permit had been issued. a total penalty of 4 000 was imposed non compliance with regulations under the dutch ma jor accidents risks decree besluit risico s zware ongevallen. a penalty of 25 000 was imposed. the total penalty was 48 250. we will continue to monitor claims that are still being processed and will report on them in a later sustainability repor t once they have been finalised. anti corruption assessment policy and goals description of the relevance of anti corruption for the company i. e. anti corruption risk assessment . description of policies public commitments and com pany goals on anti corruption. code of conduct our business stands or falls with trust and that t rust has to be earned every day. our people play an important part here. in 2012 we updated the code o f conduct that addresses important elements of desirable fair and honest conduct. the code of cond uct describes not only what conduct is expected from van gansewinkel groep s employees but also wh at the employees may expect from van gansewinkel groep. the code expands on the policy p rinciples and serves as an umbrella for other more specific codes and policy documents within the group. operational risks operational risk management refers to the process o f identifying and quantifying risks stemming from the operation of business functions at our organisa tion. operational risk management also includes deciding what control measures are necessary. contr ol measures are activities that reduce the possibility that a risk will occur or limit the pos sible consequences. the principal operational risks are fraud fraud is a phenomenon that takes many forms that h as no precise definition and that overlaps with activities such as deceit forgery abuse dat a manipulation and impersonation. van gansewinkel groep uses a broad definition of fraud intentional deception for the purpose of unlawful or illegal gain. to prevent fraud instances of fraud must naturally first come to light and come to the attention of those who can take steps. van gansewinkel groep see ks to increase the willingness to report such instances. everybody is urged to report violat ions of the code of conduct. van gansewinkel groep s code of conduct sets out important elements of desirable fair and honest conduct. the code of conduct can help employees to weigh differe nt options and to make their choices. reports can be made via the employee s immediate manager or higher management the local integrity contact and or van gansewinkel groep s integrity ma nager. employees reporting a violation or a suspicion of a violation need not worry about any r epercussions and are protected in accordance with the integrity regulations. a framework has been developed for the internal con trols for financial processes. various processes aimed at limiting fraud risks are used to verify whether functional separation is in place where necessary authorisation and delegation schedules are followe d payments are recorded and made regularly stocktakings are conducted regularly elementary elements of it security are used and cr itical data are protected integrity in 2012 the 2011 draft code of conduct was updated. since 2010 we also have been working actively to give shape and substance to the theme o f integrity. besides a corporate integrity manager we have local integrity contacts in place. furthermore we have a specific communication path for integrity related investigat ions and a complaints procedure for the manner in which integrity investigations are conducted. our integrity investigations registration system be came operational in 2012. this management system is part of our reporting system trackwise. m oreover we worked on further developing training sessions and workshops dealing with integr ity and organised a number of such sessions and workshops. furthermore van gansewinkel s integ rity manager participated in the annual integrity experts meeting a joint initiative in wh ich various national parties are presented. the purpose is to exchange not only know how and expert ise but also instruments with concrete applications in order to achieve a higher level of integrity within each of the separate organisations. in 2012 we received 21 integrity reports. some of this year s reports again came from within the organisation while others were made by individuals and institutions outside the organisation. the reports concerned two instances of aggression and v iolence internal nine instances of crime primarily theft two instances of fraud five ins tances of improper use of company assets of which five reports were in relation to illegal wast e collection either paid or unpaid one instance of improper use of confidential information and a repo rt of two armed robberies at a van gansewinkel site. of the 21 reports 19 were taken under investigatio n and two were reclassified as integrity advice and as such were designated as not requiring invest igation. three investigations are still ongoing in 2013 and two investigations were started in jan uary 2013. we are working with the police in our investigations of the armed robberies and one i nstance of internal fraud. these criminal investigations had not been completed by the end of 2012. several instances resulted in reports being filed with the police and in some cases crim inal investigations were conducted. involvement in integrity infringements led to 12 employees bein g dismissed. a worker on secondment with van gansewinkel was relieved of his duties and summaril y dismissed by his employer in connection with fraud committed at van gansewinkel. advisory reports were issued on 38 occasions during 2012. the subjects of those

5017,6302,Appendix_1.pdf,2 1. our context five years into the implementation of its strategy unisa 2015 an agenda for transformation unisa has paused to reflect on progress to reprioritize and if necessary to reformulate aspects of its strategic plan in the light of the changing institutional and higher education context. the challenges of transformation which pervade unisa 2015 remain in large measure. the central transformational challenge is to revitalize the capabilities of the u niversity concerning social developm ent the production of human capital knowledge creation and promotion of innovation. in so doing the sustainability of society is assured through future generations of highly capable critical and ethical citizens and knowledge entrepreneurs. the gradu ates we produce are being equipped to address the multitude of challenges confronting our society including the promotion of equity the sustainable use of resources tolerance of difference enhancing public health and the development of indigenous kno wledge. unisa is revisiting its strategy at a time when there is worldwide concern about higher education as a public good and as the centre for research innovation and creativity. intense demands are increasingly made on higher education as a resource to support economic development especially in the light of the global economic downturn. the downturn and the spectacular collapses of major financial institutions which precipitated it suggest s to many that our knowledge systems have failed us in ident ifying the gathering storm clouds and in devising appropriate counter measures. as an economy on a steep developmental trajectory south africa is in dire need of high level capacity in a number of fields. there are pressures from within the higher educa tion sector as well. even though national systems of higher education must be developed to the optimum the increasing internationalization of higher education and cross border mobility means that regional and international cooperation is required to prom ote quality assurance authentication of qualifications and student mobility. the challenge of access remains a priority in most of the developing world even though several developing countries including south africa have made major strides in widenin g participation and enhancing quality. the promise of open distance learning to increase access widen participation and promote quality is now widely recognized and is influencing higher education policy in many developing countries. however better endo wed and developed countries and institutions continue to have an obligation to support the development of those less privileged especially on the african continent. society continues to look to higher education institutions to undertake research that hel ps eradicate poverty promotes sustainable development advances cultural development and uplifts communities economically while fulfilling their traditional roles in scientific inquiry and human development. addressing these challenges will demand mobil ization of institutional and individual capacities. international cooperation between institutions must help ameliorate the brain drain from developing countries. it must also help narrow the development gap between the well off and the marginalized in t he global economy through knowledge transfer and the sharing of resources and capacities even as it helps build vibrant and diversified national knowledge capabilities in collaborating countries. a corollary to increased demands and expectations from high er education is the need to reaffirm institutional autonomy and academic freedom so that higher education institutions retain their independence and remain unconstrained in their pursuit of truth and social justice. higher education still sustains society though its timeless values of critical thinking research teaching and community engagement all of which drive society towards betterment. 3 2. our vision towards the african university in the service of humanity . 3. the role unisa will play in society our mission the university of so uth africa is a comp rehensive open distance learni ng institution that produces excellent scholarship and rese arch provides quali ty tuition and fosters active community engagement. we are guid ed by the principles of lifelong learning student centredness innovat ion and creativity. our efforts contribu te to the knowledge and information society advance development nurture a critical c itizenry and ensure global sustainability. lid today as it was when initially conceived. it is a signifier of our uniqueness and is deeply embedded in the consciousness of staff and students as well as that of our stakeholders and society in general through the shared value of ubuntu. indicates that the vision sets the university on a developmental journey signifying dynamism inquisitiveness a sense of adventure and boldness. it also points to clarity of purpose and destiny constantly transforming and innovating in pursuit of its vision. in the vision statement refers to the excellence that the university will continually strive for globally. the boldness of the statement is therefore intended to reflect our aspirations as a university. underscores the traditional ideals of a university to promote universality to produce and disseminate knowledge promote culture and serve causes which advance society and humanity. elaborated from the perspective of an african university it means tha t the university is one located and rooted in the african context developing knowledge skills attitudes and values necessary for the development of the african continent. 4 4. our values social justice and fairness excellence with integrity 5. our value propositio n accessible flexible and globally recognized while the vision statement of the university captures the essence of our aspir ational journey our value proposition states concisely what value our students will find at unisa that distinguishes us from other higher education providers. in providing affordable access with success unisa offers a relevant range of quality program mes from certificate to doctoral levels in a wide range of fields thereby giving expression to its identity as a comprehensive odl institution. moreover integral to our programmes of learning is intensive ict enhanced learner support which cater s for di verse student needs. the rich learning experiences of our students at unisa ensure that with corresponding effort on their part their chances of success are enhanced considera bly. this means not only that they graduate with a breadth of knowledge and sk ills nece ssary for the workplace and for critical citizenship but also with the self knowledge confidence and realization of potential necessary for lifelong learning creativity and a fulfilling life. finally unisa is an internationally recognized u niversity with an extensive geographical footprint giving our students recognition and employability in many countries the world over. inspired by the foundational precepts of our transforming society social justice and fairness remain the values that animate our strategy guide our efforts and influence our imagined future. upon further reflection it is felt that pursuit of excellence for its own sake could be sterile. excellence and integrity are therefore combined to suggest that excellence canno t be pursued as an end in itself and aloof from the major challenges confronting higher education. therefore excellence must be pursued with integrity to have value. finally ethical conduct is viewed as a critical element of integrit y. in practice i t requires correct action and decision making even in the absence of direct oversight and scrutiny. 5 6. goals and strategies goals strategies 1. revitalize the pqm teaching and lea rning. 1. simplify and streamline pqm. 2. review

5018,6303,Global_Compact_CoP_2019.pdf,our commitment ges joined the united nations global compact in 2004 and has since been strongly committed to its ten principles on human rights labour rights environment and anti corruption. in january 2019 ges was acquired by sustainalytics a leading independent environmental social and governance esg and corporate governance research ratings and analytics firm that supports investors around the world with the development and implementation of responsible investment strategies. for more than 20 years sustainalytics has promoted responsible business p ractices through our products and services including a un global compact compliance offering. culture and day to day operations. this is reflected in our vision mission and values in our code of conduct as well as in our overall dedication to sustainable development ever since the company was founded in 1992. in practice this is demonstrated in our daily work of supporting asset owners and asset managers develop and implement integrated investment strategies with esg considerations to a large extent based on the un global . due to the acquisition in january 2019 and the ges reporting cycle for cop this will be the final report from ges sustainability report aligned with the un global compact cop reporting. our external practical actions and outcome 201 8 20 1 9 o ur premier opportunity to make a difference is through our services. they are based on international norms as expressed in the un global compact principle s the oecd guidelines for multinational enterprises the un guiding principles for business and human rights as well as the un sustainable development goals sdgs . the their multilateral organisations s hould be upheld by companies operating in those countries and that they will be judged in accordance with these norms by the authorities the public and their representatives ngos media etc. therefore these agreements serve as a reasonable foundation f or evaluating companie s. business conduct engagement global standards engagement ges engage d with companies through ges business conduct engagement bce based on reported violations of international norms relating to human rights labour rights environment and corruption business ethics. in 2018 as part of this service we exchanged almost 1. 8 00 different communications including over 1 10 meetings and conference calls related to over 3 8 0 cases at 280 companies. we successfully resolved more than 30 issues and almost 50 significant milestones where identified at companies. this service has since been integrated into an engagement overl ay for the global standards screening tool. this engagement services remains the largest program with approximately 50 clients involved. in october 2018 ges published a follow investor cocoa sector. the follow up report presents significant further roll out of child labour monitoring and remediation systems in the two main coc oa producing countries globally ivory coast and ghana. it also reports a lot more movement from corporates on the topic of living income for cocoa growing farmers. as an example several cocoa and chocolate companies were involved in conducting living inc ome benchmarks for cocoa growing farmers in ivory coast and ghana finalised in 2018 19. in summary even though a lot of work remains cocoa companies benchmarked in the report and engaged by ges sustainalytics strengthened their efforts on the topics ab ove during the last year. the engagemen t continues with several engagement meetings stakeholder dialogues and cocoa conference participation by sustainalytics and its investor clients in the pipeline. stewardship risk engagement sustainalytics contin ued to work on thematic engagements focusing on raising standards across industries and creating positive change on some of the most challenging esg issues globally. the different themes cover different spectrum of sdgs but ultimately the entire stewardsh ip risk engagement s r programme addresses all of the sdgs. currently sustainalytics offers the following proactive impact oriented engagement themes 1 child labor in cocoa climate transition cybersecurity in healthcare food supply chain japan stewardship localized water management mining tailings legacy risk plastics and the circular economy sustainable seafood taxation below are some selected developments during the reporting period in january 2019 sustainalytics initiated a three year engagement programme on plastics and the circular economy. the programme focuses on how companies in consumer facing sectors such as automotive electronics consumer goods and packa ging are managing plastics within their sourcing and waste management strategies. the ultimate objective is to encourage companies to improve the quality and economics of recycling practices to shift strategic focus towards redesign and innovation and to increase the reusability of products so as to enable a transformation of the plastics market towards sustainability. the work so far has been focused on establishing an initial engagement with 21 companies across the automotive electronics and consumer a nd packaging goods sectors. the target companies are measured up against six key performance indicator categories including governance and reporting input in the production process and utility during use risk and impact assessment recycling practices an metrics enables investors to track and compare the development of individual companies in applying circular economy solutions to the issue of plastic waste. sustainalytics has also continu ed its engagement on sustainable seafood closely linked to sdgs 12 responsible consumption and production and 14 life below water. the ultimate engagement goal is to ensure that companies approach to managing seafood sustainability risks proactively a nd efficiently contributes to long term operational continuity and is environmentally sustainable. during the reporting period substantial engagement dialogues with the companies have proceeded and they all some level of commitment to sustainable seafood although gaps in performance are visible. several of the companies in the engagement have expressed that the dialogue with sustainalytics has contributed to highlighting the importance of sustainable seafood management for investors which has resulted in increased efforts to create policies and programmes. in june 2019 sustainalytics participated in a sustainable seafood engagement trip to the faroe islands together with investors. apart from meeting with companies and other stakeholders several onsite visits at aquaculture farms were carried out to study real life management practices. during the reporting period sustainalytics completed its three year project on w ater which included engagement with approximately 20 companies in food and beverage garment and mining industries with a particular exposure to water stressed developing countries. the engagement objectives and kpis were aligned with sdg 6 targets and the di alogue consisted of over 800 emails and 40 conference calls and meetings. in the course of the engagement the target companies made most progress on evaluating water related risks and developing mitigation measures as well as assessing and addressing wat er pollution. conversely we saw least progress in connection to integrated water resources management. the engagement was preceded and followed by benchmarking assessments of a wider universe of companies in the three focus sectors in 2017 and 1 themes marked by asterisk were added to the s r programme in the reporting period. 2019 respec tively aimed at establishing the status and tracking developments in corporate water management in our three focus sectors. the 2019 results found that as a whole the companies we had engaged with displayed a greater improvement in water management over the two years of the programme than the 282 other companies in the universe. in summer 2019 sustainalytics launched a new thematic engagement on water focused on localised risks and interlinkages. during 2018 2019 sustainalytics engaged with 101 compa nies within the emerging markets engagement eme programme of which 76 were onsite meetings. the engagements covered companies in argentina brazil china hong kong india malaysia mexico russia south africa south korea poland thailand and the ph ilippines. work. the eme programme is designed to give participating investors an in depth and up to date insight into ement of material esg risks while also supporting and encouraging companies flagship product esg risk rating which enables impact through a focus on highest unmanaged esg risks. for 2019 2020 the eme programme is on track to exceed the activity level of the previous year. during the first half of the year the esg risk rating has been integrated into the engagement process which has also led to a transition towards engagement selections based on highest unmanaged esg risks. this approach is well aligned with the oecd responsible business conduct for institutional investors. in our food supply chain engagement focused on raising the bar against child labour and forced labour in the food and beverage and food retailing sectors about 20 companies were engaged during 2018 19. we saw general improvements labour rights due diligence including mitigation and collaboration efforts. one company made s ubstantial progress by publishing its new human rights strategy to which ges and later sustainalytics provided feedback. a focus area for this thematic engagement in 2019 2020 will be living income living wages among other issues. in july 2018 sustainalytics launched its climate transition engagement with the cement and steel sectors. the climate debate has shifted dynamically to transition gaining urgency with the release of the 2018 intergovernmental panel on climate change repo rt. the cement and steel sectors represent over 10 of anthropogenic emissions and form a core element of built infrastructure and transportation. the engagement seeks to align with objectives of climate action 100 and task force for climate related fin ancial disclosures. it is closely linked to sustainable development goals 6 9 11 and 13. the three year engagement focuses on furthering financial and risk disclosure science based target setting industry roadmaps scenario analysis technological inno vation resilient infrastructure physical risk management water stewardship and industry positions consistent with climate objectives. sustainalytics commenced selection and baseline reporting for 20 companies globally with a combined sizeable emissions footprint and comparatively high emissions intensity. the first round of conversations with engagement companies commenced in december 2018. ges corporate governance engagement and proxy voting sustainalytics corporate governance engagement is focused on corporate governance issues such as board . from august 2018 until august 2019 we had 34 conference calls and met with 28 companies as part of the sustainalytics corporate governance engagement. we have also attended two annual general meetings. we targeted companies for engagement based on a numbe r of criteria including general meeting voting related issues event driven concerns and portfolio characteristics and focused on materiality when evaluating companies and their risks. sustainalytics also provides proxy voting services to institutional investors providing vote recommendations and executing votes on behalf of its clients. as part of its proxy voting service sustainalytics submitted votes to approximately 3 000 general meetings of companies in developed and emerging markets on behalf of four clients. sustainalytics also continued spreading best practice and knowledge sharing by taking part in discussions over changes in national governance codes on the european level and by attending governance related conferences. positive impacts of ges engagement we are continuously conducting extensive engagement with hundreds of companies in order to make them improve esg performance. the engagement activities consist of e. g. company dialogue and meetings resolutions and voting as well as coordination of the work of several of our clients. during the reporting period companies regarding several of the un global compact principles for example human rights following ges engagement efforts two companies in the extractive sector made their first public human rights commitments in 2019. sustainalytics is continuing the engagement with both companies on human rights due diligence and remediation. sustainalytics has been engaging with several companies involved in imports of phosphate rock from western sahara for nearly a decade. during 2018 we engaged with a company that was a result of a merger between two of the largest importers of phosphate ro ck from western sahara. the company ended its legacy imports of phosphate rock at the end of 2018 and would no longer import phosphate rock. furthermore the company improved its human rights approach and responsible sourcing framework. also ges engaged w ith two other companies that had ceased its imports from western sahara but were still working in its responsible sourcing approach. during 2018 and 2019 these companies developed policies and processes regarding ethical sourcing and human rights due dili gence across its business units and supply chain. sustainalytics has engaged for a number of years with a major oil and gas producer regarding oil pollution in the niger delta and its related human rights impacts. we have encouraged the company to enhanc e disclosure as to the steps it has taken both on its own and with other stakeholders to address the recommendations of an environmental assessment issued by an international comp and other recommendations. over the course of the dialogue we were able to discuss the issues with senior management and observed that the majority of the recommendations had been partly or completely fulfilled. for example the company states that it has reassessed and or remediated priority sites made improvements to its remediation system and supported education training and surveillance activities to prevent illegal tapping o f pipelines. although challenges remain we believe that the engagement has helped to drive greater transparency and create momentum towards full implementation of the independent assessment. labour rights sustainalytics has concluded its engagement with a textile company regarding allegations of labour rights violations in its supply chain including substandard working conditions such as lack of personal protective equipment freedom of association and exc essive overtime. sustainalytics has had a constructive dialogue with the company which has made progress related to the allegations and now has a human rights policy based on relevant international conventions and a human rights committee in place. the c ompany has also informed that it conducts regular monitoring of textile suppliers covering 70 per cent of the production. at the same time it has increased transparency in its public reporting by releasing a list of its main partners and publicly disclos ing a list of fabric mills at the end of 2018. sustainalytics concluded its engagement with a company in relation to allegations thailand. as a response to the allegations the company terminated business ties with those suppliers which might have been linked to improper labour practices and developed a strategy to address the above mentioned issues. over the course of the engagement sustainalytics discussed among other things traceability enhancement supplier risk assessment grievance mechanisms as well as an education p rogramme provided to migrants. in 2018 the company implemented its fishing vessel improvement programme and vessel code of conduct vcoc to provide guidance to the fishing vessels from which the company sources. this also improved labour and ethical per formance in the fishing sector. the vcoc is an extension of the business labour and ethics code of conduct which is based on 12 principles that are aligned with the un global compact principles. due to the measures taken by the company to address human an d labour issues sustainalytics decided to resolve the case. sustainalytics continues its engagement with another company over improper labour practices at indonesian palm oil plantations owned by and supplying to the company. the engagement focuses on so cial topics including wages temporary workers child labour and forced labour. over the course of the engagement the company has developed a dedicated sustainability dashboard on the corporate website with information on traceability supply chain manage ment grievance mechanisms and sustainability reports. the company provides details on the grievances logged through its own grievance procedure and the roundtable on sustainable palm oil complaints system. the company has also formalized and continued col laboration with different non profit organisations focused on improving labour practices across supply chains. environment sustainalytics has engaged a number of banks over involvement in financing of controversial hydropower projects related to environmental and human rights risks. although banks often have limited leverage to influence hydropower projects once they are up an d running the engagement has led to some of the banks strengthening their internal credit policies and processes to also include non financial factors such as environmental and social into the credit approval process. one bank has implemented a screening checklist based on international finance corporation standards consisting of 25 environmental and social areas that need to be accounted for before approving a loan. another bank has an exclusion list specifying the types of business it will not finance to ensure addressing environmental and social risks. anti corruption sustainalytics engaged with a brazilian company over its alleged involvement in a corruption scheme that was uncovered as part of the operation weak meat investigation. sustainalytics has been in dialogue with the company and met them in person in june 2019. after the investigation started the company has strengthened its ethics and compliance programme including the creation of a transparency committee t he incorporation of a chief compliance officer and a new compliance and investigation team and the implementation of a new compliance system which includes employee training in conflict of interests anticorruption and integrity a robust whistleblower s ystem to be used by both customers and suppliers global policies and guidelines on anti bribery and anti corruption and business partners monitoring. the company is still working in its ethics and compliance work but it has substantially improved its an ti corruption procedures. sustainalytics engaged with a south korean company over its alleged involvement in a corruption scandal involving the impeached president of south korea. since the corruption scandal involved the top management the company has made meaningful changes in its corporate governance and now all donations and sponsorships of a significant amount require approval from the board. furthermore the company has strengthened the independence of the board of directors and its eth ics and compliance program. the company is still working in its ethics and compliance work but it has substantially improved its corporate governance and anti corruption procedures. hanna roberts engagement director sustainalytics previous ceo of ges august 30 201 9,19627

our stakeholders using our primary channels of communication. mark h prior group managing director february 2016page 2 of 7 human rights principles assessment policy and goals human rights in relation to group employees are addressed in the company handbook. in particular the general code of conduct requires all staff to treat with respect everyone they deal with and further policies deal specifically with bullying and equality and discrimination. the sphere of influence of lff group in the field of human rights beyond our staff and contractors is limited. we are nevertheless carrying out an assessment of human rights related risk and impact beyond our own organization to assess the practicability of steps we might take to engage with our supply chain on these issues. implementation we carry out staff training in this area reinforcing awareness of existing policies throughout the organization and to ensure that all employees know how to report any grievances. measurement of outcomes we have not had any instances reported of human rights violations within the group. any such instances would be dealt with through the grievance procedure and reported at board level to ensure appropriate follow up and remedial action where necessary. page 3 of 7 labour principles assessment policy and goals lff group complies with all relevant employment legislation in the

information updates throughout the year. we have also used our platforms to raise awareness about how to fight covid 19 together. nent group has continued to raise awareness of the benefits of

report remuneration report the share governance report ceo s statement 2020 was an extraordinary and challenging year in many ways a year that will change many things forever including how we work together look after each other society and the environment. our strategy resilience flexibility and culture have all been put to the test and it is great to see that nent group will emerge from this crisis stronger more sustainable better positioned and better prepared for the future. we have gone further by dramatically accelerating our transformation during 2020 and setting clear goals to become the european streaming champion and one of the most diverse and equal companies in the global entertainment industry. 4ceo s statement our strategy and story our people sustainability sustainability reporting financial statements administration report remuneration report the share governance report this is our second integrated financial and sustainability report as a listed company and it is integrated because our financial planning and performance walk hand in hand with our sustainability strategy and esg performance. that is how we develop our strategy and run our business in order to generate long term sustainable value for our owners employees customers and all stakeholders. 2020 proved just how relevant resilient and flexible nent group is. we acted early and decisively when the coronavirus impacted in order to keep everyone safe and healthy to entertain our customers at home to reduce prices when certain content was not available and to reduce all non essential costs so that we could safeguard all jobs. these actions included a 700 million cost saving programme the application for various government assis tance programmes the reduction in viaplay sports pack age prices while live sports events were not happening the postponement of productions during lockdowns and the withdrawal of the annual cash dividend. we have also helped where we can to make a contribution to those in society who have been most affected by the crisis. the impacts on our business have been very different. on the one hand people staying at home led to a signifi cant acceleration in the growth of viaplay as we raised our subscriber growth target three times and ended the year by meeting our milestone of 3 million paying viaplay subscribers. this represented a growth of 33 and the average number of minutes viewed over the year was also up more than 30. churn remained at low levels as subscribers watched a wide range of new viaplay con tent including the premieres of 30 new viaplay original productions. we had over 80 original productions on viaplay by the end of the year and will definitely pass the 100 originals milestone in 2021 as we premiere a further 40 new titles. the resilience and adaptability of the viaplay platform was proven yet again with 99. 97 service accessibility 57 billion minutes of streamed content and many new user experience features delivered by our team of more than 400 developers. and we even success fully launched viaplay in iceland on 1 april during lockdown 2020 was a year in which we all faced new challenges and found new ways of working. the safety and wellbeing of our people has been our greatest priority and we took early and decisive actions to protect the business and ensure that we would bounce back quickly once the environment improved. we have entertained millions of people at home during this period and accelerated our transformation towards our goal of being the european streaming champion. our strategy is all about sustainable development and the creation of long term value for all stakeholders. viaplay launched in iceland on 1 april 5ceo s statement our strategy and story our people sustainability sustainability reporting financial statements administration report remuneration report the share governance report on the other hand our advertising subscription and production revenues were of course all impacted heavily by the pandemic with substantial revenue and profit declines in q2 in particular. the strength and flexibility of our supplier and customer relationships was essential in enabling our teams to find solutions and ensure that we could bounce back swiftly as markets returned. as a result of all the above we returned to healthy organic revenue and profit growth in the second half of the year. overall our organic sales were slightly up for the year while like for like profits were down less than 13. in line with our strategy to focus on our streaming oper ations we further streamlined the group during 2020 by finalising the allente joint venture and reorganising our content production studios. the merger of our viasat consumer satellite pay tv and broadband business with telenor s canal digital to form allente creates a scale nordic player with over 1. 1 million subscribers. not only will this enable us to capture significant synergies through our 50 shareholding but will also bring viaplay and our linear channels to even more households through our long term agreement with allente. the newly formed company has already refinanced itself and paid out a sek 2. 4 billion dividend at the end of the year with further dividends to be paid in 2021. we are in the process of selling the majority of our non core content production and distribution businesses to new owners so that those that remain can focus purely on the delivery of original content to viaplay. it has been clear for a while now that we have been ready and able to expand viaplay outside the nordic region. storytelling is in our dna and we know that there is a rising demand for our original acquired and sports content in these new markets which has only accelerated in the past year with the changes in consumer behaviour and the rise in streaming video consumption. our platform can compete with the best globally and is agile enough to be deployed into new markets in a financially sound way. we know that our original content can travel given the number of broadcasters and streamers around the world who have bought the rights to show our formats. the relationships that we have developed over many years and across multiple markets with the hollywood and international studios and with the owners of the major sports rights make us confident that we can secure the content that we want for new markets on attractive terms. and the flexible new functional organisation that we put in place in 2019 lends itself perfectly to interna tional expansion. furthermore the window of opportunity is now as we are well ahead of our peers and the market shares of tomorrow are being handed out today. the 5 year strategy and plan that we presented to our stakeholders in november laid out the roadmap for both our nordic and international operations enabling us to more than double our organic sales more than triple our organic profits and more than triple our viaplay sub scriber base by substantially increasing our penetration in the nordics and entering 10 new international markets. the nordic story is driven by our strategic content investments and firm belief that every household will in time subscribe the beat summit employee event in november 2020 6ceo s statement our strategy and story our people sustainability sustainability reporting financial

financial flexibility which was then approved at our egm and resulted in the raising of sek 4. 35 billion via a directed new share issue after the end of the year. nent group is becoming a more and more diverse group in many ways and it has been great to see this rec ognised in both internal and external surveys over the past year. we want to be one of the most equal entertainment companies in the world and our drive for greater inclusion affects our relationships with all of our stakeholders from the ever increasing variety of content that we show on our platforms to the gender equality in our workforce and from the 45 nationalities represented in our teams to to multiple streaming services. looking forwards not only will we produce more and more of our own award winning originals and show even more movies series and kids content but we will soon be the home of premier league football in norway formula one in finland and fis skiing across the region and we have secured landmark multi year rights to premium men and women s football motor racing handball ice hockey golf and many other events. we have analysed a large number of candidate international markets for our expansion and decided on the initial 5 where we have secured key content rights we are negotiating distribution partnership deals to accel erate our development and we have detailed consumer insight and go to market plans. we discussed the plans how we think about our role in society and the responsibility to respect and protect each other and the environment. 2020 showed that we are on the right track. we are now taking a further step by committing to the science based targets initiative to become carbon net zero and ensure that the positive environmental effects of 2020 are a lesson well learned. we continue to be a proud signatory of the un global compact and media compact as well as the women s empowerment principles. our work towards our various sustainable development goals has been rated highly by the world s leading esg indices. none of this would have been possible without the exceptional commitment and creativity of our people. we have a culture based on values bravery equality appreciation trust that were chosen by our people and a common purpose that was also chosen by our people tell ing stories touching lives expanding worlds. this is what binds us together it is our heartbeat. and this is why the mea sured engagement levels and employee net promoter score for nent group increased during 2020 even though nearly all of us were working remotely throughout the year. so a very big thank you to everyone for all that has been achieved in 2020 and for the ground work that we have now laid for our nordic development and interna tional expansion. we continue to build nent brick by brick. and thank you to you more than ever this year for supporti ng nent group. we wish you the very best and look forward to a busy and exciting 2021 in which we hope to see each other

most accessible platforms. being a content champion is about quality as much as quantity. viewer tastes are highly individual and change over time. viaplay s content strategy therefore spans three major content categories original content acquired content and sports content. each one of these has a number of sub categories such as live sports international movies and series kids shows local language scripted drama and non scripted reality. today viaplay has category leadership in several of these areas through a combi nation of investments in acquired and original content. nent group has built streaming platforms that compete with the best in terms of performance functionality and content discovery and we also make our linear channels available on as many third party platforms as possible. partners for our partners we focus on creating win win relation ships. long term innovative partnerships are key to accel erating our growth and driving value. in 2020 we formed a number of strategic partnerships on both the content and distribution sides of the business. one example is our ground breaking partnership in finland with tele communications and digital services provider elisa to com bine our viaplay films series package with elisa viihde aitio s content into a new standalone streaming service. another example is our partnership with lionsgate s starz to make viaplay

creation of our new purpose and values the move from a country to function based organisation the merger of our satellite pay tv business to create allente the reorganisation of our studios operations and now the imminent inter national expansion of viaplay are just some of the strategic moves that we have made in recent years. our strategy our sustainability strategy is tightly linked with our busi ness strategy. our ambition is to make a positive impact in society and for our stakeholders by doing better business. our sustainability work consists of a number of key focus areas developing nordic storytelling and the creative industry promoting an equal diverse and inclusive society and driving excellence in our culture conduct and content. integrating these areas into everything that we do is key to our success and delivering on our ambitions and targets. we have put extra focus on equality diversity and inclusion during 2020 with the launch of an edi strategy and the conducting of equality workshops with the majority of our people. we have also acceler ated our environmental work with the commitment to the science based targets initiative in order to align our emissions targets with the ambitions of the paris agreement. 11ceo s statement our people sustainability sustainability reporting financial statements administration report remuneration report the share governance report our strategy and story our story nent group is first and foremost a video streaming story. our early and substantial investments into streaming have firmly established viaplay as one of the leading streaming services in the nordics. we are now ready for the next chapter in our story as we aim to drive value in the nordics through accelerated sales growth and gradual margin expansion as well as to expand viaplay internationally into ten new markets by the end of 2023. our aim is to be the european streaming champion and we have high ambitions as we start this next chapter from a position of strength with leadership positions in the key areas of content technology and people. the nordic story nent group has a proven track record in the nordics. we have transformed ourselves while continuing to deliver profitable growth. 70 of our sales now come from subscriptions with viaplay accounting for 30 of group sales. the focus on these growing and recurring revenue streams has improved both our visibility and resilience while reducing volatility which allows us to take a more aggressive and long term approach when reinvesting profits back into the business in order to accelerate growth and value creation. this is a model that has worked well for us and is expected to continue to do so. viaplay is a must have service viaplay is firmly established as one of the top two streaming services in the nordics. early and substantial investments into content content discovery and the platform have ensured that viaplay is top of mind and the leading premium nordic video streaming service. viaplay s nordic content offering includes premium sports original scripted and non scripted content acquired local and international series and movies and kids content. viaplay has leading positions in sports original content movies and kids content and a number of our more than 80 originals have been made available internationally and proven popular with viewers around the world. our technology platform also competes with the best around the world in terms of performance functionality and content discovery. viaplay is growing fast viaplay s paying subscriber base grew by 33 in 2020 to reach and exceed our target of 3 million. this represents a significant acceleration and reflects the growth in the business to business segment in particular where we have formed strategic distribution partnerships with the major traditional linear subscription tv providers in each of our markets. our direct to consumer base is also growing at healthy levels and the mix of basic and premium subscribers has remained at constant levels. 12ceo s statement our people sustainability sustainability reporting financial statements administration report remuneration report the share governance report our strategy and story the content offering can be divided into three categories with sub categories in each one. 13ceo s statement our people sustainability sustainability reporting financial statements administration report remuneration report the share governance report our strategy and story sales split 2020 viaplay subscriber base 1 svod penetration market size svod subscriptions household viaplay subscriber base significant growth opportunity in the nordics source nent analysis 1 paying subscribers including subscribers that have access to viaplay through traditional pay tv packages 14ceo s statement our people sustainability sustainability reporting financial statements administration report remuneration report the share governance report our strategy and story and there is significant market growth potential viaplay has grown fast and there is plenty of room for fur ther growth in the nordic markets. approximately 60 of nordic households subscribe to at least one video stream ing service today and we believe that this penetration level will increase to approximately 80 over the next five years. in line with previous paradigm shifts in communication such as broadcast television and mobile telephony we see no reason why the penetration will not reach 100 in time. each nordic streaming household has an average of approximately 1. 9 streamed video subscriptions today and we expect this to rise to approximately 3 subscrip tions per household by the end of 2025 as it has already done in the us for example. streaming is clearly not a winner takes it all market but establishing and maintain ing a leadership position requires the technological excel lence and content differentiation that viaplay has consis tently delivered. these factors combined with rising prices from the currently low levels in the basic tiers in particular indicate that the nordic streaming market will more than double in value over the next 5 years. which is why we have ambitious targets we expect to double the number of viaplay subscribers in the nordics to approximately 6 million by the end of 2025. this growth will be driven by nent group s unique offering of original and acquired content as well as by the addition of key new sports rights such as the fis skiing rights across the region premier league football in norway and formula 1 motor racing in finland. we premiered 30 new original shows on viaplay in 2020 and expect to premiere a further 40 originals in 2021 including a number of documentaries and international english language scripted dramas. 15ceo s statement our people sustainability sustainability reporting financial statements administration report remuneration report the share governance report our strategy and story we also continue to be the home of the largest number of new movie premieres from hollywood favourite series and kids content and the most comprehensive live sports offering that has been secured for many years to come. given these investments we see significant opportunities to raise prices this year and beyond. combined with the anticipated subscriber intake this is why we expect viaplay to be the primary driver of the anticipated 13 15 com pound annual organic revenue growth between 2020 and 2025 for our nordic operations. higher revenues will result in operational leverage and consequently higher margins. we expect to raise the operating margin for our combined nordic operations to approximately 15 in 2025. we do expect that the under lying margin when excluding the contribution from the viasat consumer business that was deconsolidated in may 2020 will go up in 2021 and then remain stable in 2022 as the investments that we are making in the new sports rights drive both revenue and cost growth. the margin is then expected to increase in the following three years. the international expansion the performance of viaplay in the nordics as well as the successful launch of viaplay in iceland in april 2020 demonstrate that we are ready for the next chapter in our story which is to expand viaplay outside the nordic region. streaming is the future and we have the right infrastructure and skillsets to capture the unique opportu nity we see in the years ahead. all of the success factors are in place and the ambition is clear we are building the european streaming champion. we have analysed a wide range of potential markets in europe and around the world evaluating key factors such as market size streaming penetration international and local competition content availability pricing environment and partnership opportunities. based on this analysis we viaplay original animation fixi in playland leverage policy of net debt ebitda incl.

financial statements administration report remuneration report the share governance report our strategy and story have identified and announced that we will enter five new markets in 2021 with five more to come during 2022 and 2023 and we have built cases for many more for the future. we have two distinct approaches to new market entries broad or specialised. the broad approach com prises a full content offering of our originals combined with sports acquired series and movies. the specialised approach is focused around our original content offering together with complementary thematic and international content. each market entry is based on being successful with a simply and competitively priced direct to consumer offer and then we enter discussions with potential business to business distribution partners that could accelerate our market penetration. this mirrors how we have developed viaplay in the nordic region. we have launched viaplay in estonia latvia and lithua nia in march 2021 and the initial response has been very positive. the baltic service is built on a strong sport rights portfolio including uefa champions league and bundes liga football formula 1 motor racing and nhl ice hockey our viaplay originals and over 10 000 hours of inter national and local series movies and kids content. the monthly subscription is offered at an attractive and com petitive price of eur 9. 99. we do expect to add more content over time to further differentiate our proposition. there are approximately 2. 8 million households in the baltics of which approximately 15 have at least one streaming subscription and this is expected to grow to up to 50 penetration and more than two subscriptions per household by the end of 2025. distribution deals have already been signed with leading telecommunications operators to include viaplay in their video subscription packages in latvia and estonia. viaplay will then be launched in poland in august 2021 and offer over 8 000 hours of nordic local and interna tional content our viaplay originals and coverage of live sports including the hugely popular bundesliga german top tier football league uefa europa and conference leagues. 25 of poland s 13. 8 million households currently have a streaming subscription and this is expected to grow to well over 40 in 2025 with the current average of 1. 5 subscriptions per household expected to increase to over 2. the monthly subscription will be offered at an attractive and competitive price of 34 zloty and we do expect to add more content over time to further differ entiate our proposition. viaplay will be launched in the us in late 2021 as a tai lored and specialised service providing our viaplay origi nals as well as complementary high quality nordic drama series and international content. the successful track record of a number of our originals that have been shown on net works in the us as well as detailed consumer research and the clear demand for differentiated international content give us confidence that we can secure the relatively low levels of market penetration required to deliver a high growth and profitable us business. the us is the world s largest streaming market with 300 million subscriptions 80 household penetration and an average of three subscriptions per household all of which are expected to grow further in the coming years. there is a high affinity for scandinavian and international original content in the us and we will create even more new english language originals that can travel to the us and other markets. viaplay will be launched in an additional five european markets by the end of 2023 and the combined 10 markets are expected to attract approximately 4. 5 million inter national subscribers by the end of 2025. nent group s international operations are expected to grow rapidly and be ebit profitable on a combined basis in 2025 with accumulated combined losses to breakeven of approxi mately sek 2. 5 billion. the margin potential for the inter national viaplay operations is expected to be even higher than in the nordics and the development of the international operations will be reported separately in our results. the international expansion will be funded with part of the proceeds of the directed placement of 10. 6 million new nent group b shares which were issued in february 2021. the placing of the new shares with swedish and international institutional investors including certain exist ing shareholders was significantly oversubscribed and raised gross proceeds of approximately 4. 35 billion. 17ceo s statement our people sustainability sustainability reporting financial statements administration report remuneration report the share governance report our

documentaries kids content and feature films. in 2020 our productions partisan love me and box 21 have all won best series awards at major national and international ceremonies. impact through our content we produce series films and documentaries in every nordic language. creating quality content and reaching as many viewers as possible is essential for us because it enables us to engage millions of people every day. it also provides a platform to promote the nordic creative industry languages and cultures. it also enables us to make a significant contribution to local communities and talents by creating jobs in the creative industry an industry that contributes to an open vibrant and inclusive society. for this reason we invest in and develop the local creative community in each market that we expand into. despite covid 19 forcing the postponement of some of our original productions we still reached the target of premiering 30 originals in 2020 28 scripted and 10 doc umentaries. in 2021 and despite the ongoing impact of covid 19 we aim to premiere at least 40 originals includ ing scripted and documentaries which shows how well we adapt to new conditions while continuing to reach our goals. promoting talents we rely on a steady stream of new talents in the local crea tive industry to be able to continue creating relevant and innovative content for our audiences. gaining access to the creative community can be challenging for new talents which is why we planned on initiating a pan nordic recog nition concept in 2020 for talents in the creative business. due to the coronavirus pandemic we had to postpone this initiative and are planning on launching it in 2021 instead. in 2021 we are also aiming to initiate at least one produc tion created by a debutant director or writer which is a perfect opportunity for talents to gain access to the industry. in addition nent group usually hosts an annual awards ceremony in denmark every year to celebrate talents at the production companies that we work with to create content for the danish market. the awards categories include e. g. talent of the year viaplay original of the year programme

supports us in living our values of bravery equality appreciation and trust. the framework is based on accepted standards and prin ciples including those relating to human rights and it is subject to regular review see model below. business ethics programme nent group is committed to have a robust and fit for purpose business ethics programme that fosters a culture of good ethics and compliance at all levels of the com pany. nent group s business ethics programme focuses on business ethics risks such as corruption competition law data protection and sanctions. the programme is created to enable us to to raise awareness about sound business practices by having accessible policies and procedures and providing compliance training for all employees to prevent breaches of our code of conduct laws and regu lations. the programme also contains elements to detect the mistakes and breaches when they do happen enable employees to report and us to respond and remediate quickly when needed. the business risks and the pro gramme are continuously reviewed to ensure the effec tiveness of the programme. the seven core elements that form the basis of the business ethics programme are based on the principles endorsed by national regulators to climate action committing to our conduct such as the u. s. securities and exchange commission the u. s. department of justice and the uk serious fraud office. see model below. working with suppliers in 2020 we established an enhanced supplier due dili gence process to ensure the responsible management of both existing and new suppliers. suppliers that are identi fied as high risk will receive a mandatory questionnaire covering topics such as business ethics environmental work fair working conditions and health safety. the definition of high risk is based on four criteria annual contract value type of product service dependency on the product service and location of operation. a total of five suppliers were screened in 2020 and no resulting actions have been necessary. the aim is for all of our identified high risk suppli ers to have received the question naire by the end of 2021. raising awareness among our people in 2020 around 1000 employees participated in ethics compliance information sessions and or more in depth training sessions. the information sessions aimed to raise awareness about the company s steering document framework and whistleblower processes. the in depth training sessions focused on competition law and anti bribery corruption rules targeting key functions. the employee code of conduct is reviewed annually and employees are asked to sign the code every other year. by the end of 2020 90 of our employees had signed the code and 85 had also completed the associ ated e learning course

entrusted to us and to comply with all relevant data protection laws and regulations including gdpr wherever we operate. as part of this commitment we established a data protec tion governance framework in 2020 which is managed by nent group s privacy team. the framework consists of different elements to be implemented each year by each business function s data protection manager. the frame work is designed to prevent detect and investigate data privacy issues and includes a roadmap with prioritised workstreams and action points for the year along with clear ownership and deadlines to secure best practice processes and minimise risk exposure. the eu court s invali dation of the privacy shield mechanism and the handling of personal data outside the eu eea has been added to the roadmap. protecting our content from piracy is a key priority for us and our work to manage this risk is carried out by our technical operations center in close cooperation and aligned with our legal technical and operational entities. we continuously review this risk and take appropriate measures. we also cooperate with specialised external organisations such as the the audio visual anti piracy alliance and the nordic content protection. the piracy landscape is constantly evolving and requires us to continuously evaluate the preventive measures we have in place as well as potential new ones. this is carried out by dedicated resources and in an internal forum within pd t content protection committee tech which meets on a monthly basis. we have several security controls implemented in different stages of the content delivery chain. however due to the fact that piracy is illegal and action against it sometimes has to be handled by the authorities we also have to make our voice heard in regu latory processes regarding legislation and policies con cerning piracy both at an eu and national level. an exam ple of this is our participation in the european commission s stakeholder dialogues regarding the directive on copy right in the digital single market in the autumn 2019. in 2020 we contributed to consultations taking place in sweden and denmark on the respective national imple mentation of the copyright directive. any incident regarding data and content protection is documented and followed up on. in 2020 nent group did not have any incidents that had an impact on our business operations nor affected the rights and freedoms of our customers employees and business partners. human rights we comply with both internationally recognised human rights principles and the laws of the countries in which we do business. to meet our responsibilities we have established a process in 2020 for proactive and systematic identification and review of potential human rights issues and where they could occur. this process is based on our governance framework see model above and covers our own operations and supply chain. human rights are also part of the due diligence in

administration report remuneration report the share governance report sustainability our environmental efforts are focused on two areas changing behaviour by raising awareness and taking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from our business. they are important for us because we want to contribute to a more sustainable future and do our part to help tackle the environmental challenges that we are facing globally. delivering on expectations in 2020 we have seen a substantial rise in interest and expectations from the investor community consumers and our own people regarding the environment which is why we are taking a leadership role in this important area. it is not only the right thing to do but also a critical part of future proofing our business. we manage our environmental impact by raising awareness about the topic and by setting relevant tar gets that we follow up on regularly. we apply the pre cautionary principle when assessing the environmental impact of our business which means that whenever we suspect in the lack of complete scientific knowledge that a decision might have a negative environmental impact we refrain from making such decision. our goal for 2021 has been to reduce total co 2 emis sions by 10 compared to 2019. the significant reduction in business travel due to covid 19 already resulted in a 59 reduction in co 2 emissions in 2020 compared to 2019. business travel accounted for 63 of group co 2 emissions in 2020. it is our intention to manage a sustained and sub stantial reduction in business travel even after covid 19 by using our now well established virtual meeting platforms. for that reason we decreased our business travel budget for 2021 which is now approximately 40 lower than in 2019. to further support the pathway towards a zero carbon economy we also committed to the science based target initiative in 2020. in 2021 we will prepare for such targets and submit them for validation by the end of 2021. raising awareness we want our people to be aware of why protection of the environment is such an important issue for us and how we can each help by taking the necessary actions in our everyday lives. this is why nent group has a forum called green group with a cross functional representation reviewing the environmental work of the group and sug gesting and promoting ideas and activities. in 2020 we launched a one day activity called green slackathon to boost employee engagement and share knowledge about smart environmental choices and sustainable healthy lifestyles. this was followed by our first ever digital green week with panel discussions and interactive sessions featuring experts and guest speakers. we discussed climate change its impacts digital compe tence in light of the coronavirus pandemic as well as the environmental sustainability of streaming services and content production. the activities created engagement and led to idea sharing on e. g. our social platforms.

green series and movies production we want to integrate environmental criteria when decid ing on which content to produce and acquire but also to the way we produce our own content so that we use our platform and content as a voice for climate action. in 2022 viaplay will premiere the norwegian drama series made in oslo which is produced using more environmentally sustainable practices. the production has been designed to maximise recycling and the effective use of resources while minimising travel and energy consumption. all suppli ers and partners are also selected according to their envi ronmental profiles. our aim is to learn from this production and adapt best practices for future productions. taking action on climate change is everyone s responsibility and it is time for us at nent to do more. as the nordic region s leading streaming company that aims to be the european streaming champion we want to be at the forefront of positive change. it is also a key responsibility for us and other companies to learn from the radically changed way that we are operating our busi ness during the ongoing corona virus pandemic. we are proud to learn from and stand beside the science on this critical issue and to commit to the science based targets reducing our emis sions in line with the paris agree ment. anders jensen ceo climate impact of streaming we want to get better at measuring and investigating all of the direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions that we are responsible for. we want to understand better where in the value chain most emissions are being emitted and set actions to decrease these as soon as possible. in 2020 we published a report regarding the co 2 emissions from our streaming services. it turns out that the majority of the co 2 emissions in the streaming value chain exclud ing content production are from the devices used by our customers in their own homes. in 2021 we will continue to review how we can reduce energy consumption and co 2 emissions from streaming through both smarter solutions and knowledge sharing with our consumers. 36ceo s statement our strategy and story our people sustainability reporting financial statements administration report remuneration report the share governance report sustainability committing to the science based targets initiative in 2020 nent group committed to the science based targets initiative sbti the international partnership that aims to drive climate action in the private sector in line with the goals of the paris agreement. as a result we will carry out a comprehensive analysis of our direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions in 2021 including emissions from streaming technical infrastructure and content production. we will then set ambitious targets to reduce emissions across our business and supply chain over the coming years. we aim to announce long term emissions reduction targets at the start of 2022 and to become carbon net zero from no later than 2023. we will offset all remaining emissions through certified projects focusing mainly on investments into renewable energy sources. eu taxonomy and financial disclosure the eu taxonomy which will be fully implemented in 2023 aims to provide guidance for policy makers industry and investors on how best to support and invest in economic activities that contribute to achieving a climate neutral economy. it sets performance thresholds for economic activities in the shape of technical criteria to make a substantial contribution to one of the environmental objectives climate change mitigation climate change adaptation sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources transition to a circular economy pollution prevention and control and protection and restor ation of biodiversity and ecosystems while doing no significant harm to the other ones. companies should also meet minimum sustainability safeguards for exam ple the oecd guidelines on multinational enterprises. nent group is not considered to be in a sector that makes a substantial contribution to the objectives of the taxonomy but it is possible that we work with suppliers that are. the details of the eu taxonomy are still under development and we will monitor this closely in 2021 to make sure we contribute in the best way we can wher ever that is possible. the financial stability board fsb created the task force on climate related financial disclosures tcfd to improve and increase the reporting of climate related financial information. the tcfd focuses not on the impact companies have on climate change but rather on what impact climate change might have on companies. the recommendations from tcfd are structured around four areas metrics and targets risk management strategy and govern ance. nent group already takes climate change into consideration in its risk management process and it is therefore covered in our targets strategy and governance structure. we will develop our risk scenario analys is in 2021 in order to be able to disclose more infor mation about the potential risks that we could face. production of heder 37ceo s statement our strategy and story our people sustainability reporting

covid 19 we had to adapt our ways of working with user research by moving from in person interviews and tests to online solutions. our user panels are today based on a swedish population but we will broaden our research to include other nordic countries in 2021 and look into the possibility of expanding our user panels to the new markets that we are entering. we create a child oriented streaming

various aspects during which we saw an increasing unpredictability worldwide. in the european union and from a political standpoint it was a year of strong emotions. in germany angela merkel was re elected for a fourth term but her party cdu lost considerable support recording its worst result since 1949. the most structural change however began with the far right party entering the german bundestag which won 94 seats for the afd party thus becoming germany s third strongest of post war germany that a clearly far right party has a seat in parliament. and it happened the government led by angela merkel opened its doors to migrants and refugees in 2015 allowing over one million people to enter the country. of the far right in europe in the netherlands the anti islam anti immigration and anti eu party led by geert wilders pvv won 20 seats in parliament eight more than it previously had. today it is the second largest party even though it failed to reach its goal of becoming the largest dutch parliamentary force. in 2017 the opposite note came from france with emmanuel macron s overwhelming victory in the second round of the presidential election against marine le pen 66. 1 against 33. 9. a victory that was immediately repeated in the parliamentary elections with macron s newly formed party winning a majority from voters clearly supporting the new french president s reforming pro european and inclusive vision. in portugal the crisis in neighbouring catalonia which today is politically fractured was followed closely. a slowdown in the spanish economy is expected which will should it occur affect portugal given the country s weight as an important destination for portuguese exports approximately 25 of total exports. for the portuguese 2017 will above all be remembered for its inseparable link to the human lives and according to an estimate from the european forest fire information system approximately 500 thousand hectares were burned including the irreplaceable pinhal de leiria leiria pine forest with its 700 years of history. the devastation caused by this violent destruction which saw the government fail in its duty to protect people and property overshadowed positive economic news. in fact increase in the portuguese republic s rating are good indicators of recovery albeit with an opposition in the social sectors of the state which is expected to increase as well as the structural reforms that are yet to be implemented. at the jer nimo martins group in a year in which we celebrated our 225 th anniversary we broke the 100 000

once again the polish economy achieved robust growth which stood at 4. 6 in 2017 2. 9 in 2016. domestic demand was the main growth driver also sustained by the subsidies within the scope of the family 500 plus programme whereby families were attributed 500 zlotys child in higher income families as well as by the decrease in unemployment combined with the substantial increases in salaries. investment recovery which can mainly be explained by the increase in funds from the european union was another contributing factor towards the country s economic growth. the increase in demand for labour was partially accompanied by job offers. unemployment reached historically low levels 7. 3 with an increasingly large number of employers reporting which caused a rise in salaries. in 2017 the zloty recorded an average annual exchange rate 1 of 4. 2539 against the euro which represents an appreciation of 2. 5 compared to the 4. 3627 recorded in 2016. the year end foreign exchange position also appreciated against the euro 5. 3 with a 4. 1770 and 4. 4103 rate for 2017 and 2016 respectively. the annual growth of the cpi remained moderate at 2. 0 notwithstanding the increasing pressure on domestic demand and the growth albeit slower of import prices. on the other hand the price of decrease in the offer of fruit due to adverse weather conditions during spring and then by the increase in the price of some products worldwide namely milk butter and eggs. the price of non food goods and the stable growth in the price of services contributed modern food retail according to pmr research the modern food retail market grew by 4. 6 in 2017 4. 2 in 2016 reaching in excess of 265 billion zlotys. this growth was prompted by the considerable increase in household disposable income driven by the positive environment in the job market growth in pay supported by the substantial increase in the minimum wage and by the partially delayed impact of the family 500 plus programme launched by the polish government impact on private consumption which grew by almost 5 in real terms and on the structure of household spending. households allocated the additional income not only to better meeting 1 average annual exchange rate determined by weighting the turnover of the group s companies operating in this currency. 31jer nimo martins 225 years growing their needs in terms of essential goods but to the purchase of electrical appliances tourism cars and to buying and repairing their homes. equally there was an increase in spending on entertainment and also an increase in savings. the projected growth for the sale of non food products is 1. 5 to 2 times higher than the forecast growth of food based products. as such it is not surprising that retail chains have placed greater importance on non food products. the strong competition and the changes in consumption patterns and consumer behaviour resulted in the increasing popularity of smaller sized stores situated closer to where consumers live or work. convenience stores became a popular format which is where openings were concentrated and where many chains tested or planned to test formats that are better adapted to the increased consumer s convenience needs. in the food retail sector there was still room for consolidation the number of independent stores having decreased in line with the trend of previous years. the market remained highly competitive with the major organised retail chains leading the growth but also with chains of small local stores and supermarkets continuing to have substantial representation. the medium and long term outlook is positive. consumption should continue to rise alongside the increase in salaries with a positive impact on food retail. however for 2018 the main risk factor for the sector will be the ban on stores opening on sundays. it is predicted that this restriction will start in march 2018 affecting two sundays per month and that it will progressively be extended over the coming years so that in 2020 it will only be permitted to open on seven sundays in the year. health and beauty retail according to pmr research s projections the polish health and beauty market grew by 4. 7 in 2017 5. 7 in 2016 reaching 23 billion zlotys. 2018 should see the same growth dynamics and post a similar pace the market being estimated to reach 24. 1 billion zlotys. the good economic situation recorded in poland in 2017 had a very positive impact on the development of the health and beauty market. the fall in unemployment the increase in the minimum wage and the family 500 plus improvement in the polish population s purchasing private consumption in the country. on the other hand there were other non economic factors that were relevant for the evolution of the cosmetics market in poland which were related to changes in consumer behaviour and to the activities of several players. consumers are increasingly demanding in their search for novelties natural products local brands and specialized products professional range and dermo cosmetic products. great value is also placed on convenient shopping and store services. on the other hand social networks and 2. what we did 32 are gaining more and more importance especially among the younger generations. the ageing population has also changed consumer behaviour with regard to buying more specialized and anti ageing products. the market remained very competitive both regarding price and promotions. simultaneously the discount stores continued to develop their offer in the hygiene and personal care product category namely cosmetics. openings continued to take place. health and beauty market will continue to grow at an average rate of more than 4 the products factors when it comes to consumer choice. 2. 2. portugal macroeconomic environment in 2017 gdp increased by 2. 7 the largest expansion cycle that extended to all the countries in the euro zone home to portugal s main commercial partners as well as from the very favourable evolution of the tourism sector. according to the latest information from banco de portugal december 2017 this growth was the result of an increase in domestic demand contribution from private consumption 2. 2 vs. 2. 1 in 2016 and the strong growth in investments 8. 3 vs. 1. 6 in 2016. the increase in private consumption was essentially recorded in durable goods while the boost in investments was in construction machinery and equipment and transport material. growth of 7. 7 4. 1 in 2016 with substantial gains in market share where of particular note is the positive contribution from tourism and the automotive sector boosted by the increase in its productive capacity. at the same time imports picked up growing 7. 5 after by the increase in the prices of energy mostly in the second half of the year. improve as a result of a certain increase in actual disposable income the progressive improvement in the job market and the continued favourable regarding the job market employment evolved very favourably with the unemployment rate dropping to 8. 9 11. 2 in 2016. the 0. 6 in 2016 as a result of the rise in the price of imports and the slight increase in unit labour costs. food prices increased by 1. 5 0. 5 in 2016. 1. 2 of gdp 2. 0 in 2016 below the target of 1. 5 set by the european commission. this reduction is mostly due to the economic recovery the fall in interest expenses and lower than budgeted public investment. nevertheless 33jer nimo martins 225 years growing despite this reduction in the medium term there are risks of budgetary instability as a result of the increase in interest rates which with portugal s level of public debt could mean a strong increase in annual interest expenses. modern food retail in 2017 the food retail market recorded a positive evolution both in specialized establishments and in non specialized ones with a 4. 1 growth in sales keeping broadly the same evolution as the previous year. the competitive environment continued to be highly challenging with intense levels of promotional activity as was the case in the previous years. the pace of expansion of new food retail stores was also maintained in particular in the proximity formats as well as the refurbishment of the existing store network. trend of the last few years reinforcing their move towards convenient solutions that facilitate their daily routine and towards more conscious consumption with regard to the impact on their health and well being. on the other hand consumers will remain focused on rationalising their shopping and so price promotion will continue therefore to be a critical factor when choosing their favourite store. wholesale market during 2017 the turnover of the cash carry operators in portugal recorded a positive trend 8. 4 according to tsr nielsen cash carry market which was helped decisively by the dynamics in the horeca channel. the excellent performance of the tourism sector. according to ine portuguese national statistics institute in the months from january to november 2017 the number of guests in hotels and other types of accommodation increased by 8. 7. the network of wholesale stores remained stable while of particular note is the opening of a new recheio store in vila nova de gaia. it should also be noted that garcias a company specialized in selling wines and spirits opened its 6th establishment in 2017. regarding traditional retail we would highlight the re opening of 29 stores with the amanhecer brand and the continuity of the opening of meu super stores thereby reinforcing the proximity positioning of both chains operated by small retailers all across the country. it is predicted that the wholesale market will continue to perform well in 2018 with a positive impact from tourism. 2. 3. colombia macroeconomic environment in 2017 economic growth in colombia softened compared to the previous year with gdp posting an increase of 1. 5 the lowest since 2009. adverse effect of the tax reform which led to a sharp drop in consumption and in private investment. the more accentuated than expected slowdown in economic growth caused a greater reduction in tax revenue than forecast by the government with meant that some of the planned structural public investments were postponed such as investment in road infrastructures. moreover despite the very of the oil price was lower than expected with the competitive environment activity. 2. what we did 34the external environment was also not the most favourable with latin america presenting very modest growth combined with a backdrop of social tension. slowdown reaching 9. 4 in 2017 0. 2 p. p. higher than in 2016 9. 2 in 2016. still higher than the colombian central bank s target 3. 0 1. 0 p. p. . even so the lower interest rate by 275 basis points during the year from 7. 5 to 4. 75 . during 2017 the colombian peso recorded an average appreciation against the euro of 1. 3. an improvement to the colombian economy is expected for 2018 supported by increased their purchasing power due to the increase in vat that already was incorporated in 2017 and at the anticipated that general elections will take place in march and presidential elections in may june. modern food retail the colombian retail market showed timid growth reform which had a strong impact on consumption the food retail in colombia grew again versus 2016 however at a slower pace than in the previous year with traditional retail and independent supermarkets recording a relatively stable evolution and modern organized retail growing in comparison to the previous year. the number of openings in 2017 was led by the discount format where over 500 stores opened. there were other types of formats opening up although to a much lesser extent and some closures mainly due to the integration in other retail companies. the weight of the sales of the discount stores in modern food retail increased to 13 considering being more price oriented in an environment of lower economic growth. the pace of this format s expansion also contributed towards the evolution recorded. in 2017 the colombian central bank s reduction of the reference interest rate several times from 7. 5 in 2016 to 4. 75 made it possible to partially offset the slowdown in household consumption. growth in the discount format which should also gain

organised112the corporate bodies remuneration policy which should continue having in attention the current legal and recomendatory framework as well as the organisational model adopted by the board of directors. with respect to the organisation of the board of directors the remuneration committee has especially taken into account the following characteristics delegated duties regarding the day to day management of the company as well as of a director or directors to whom the board have entrusted or may entrust special duties the participation of non executive directors in specialised committees who are therefore called to devote increased time to company s affairs. considering the said organisational model the remuneration committee understands that there are no grounds justifying any major changes in the principles that have been adopted as to the corporate bodies remuneration policy. bodies in 2017 and in order to guarantee that the company pay levels are adequate and in line with the international market practices as this is the landscape where the company operates the remuneration committee relied on benchmark studies 3. such studies included not only other companies in the psi 20 but also other listed european international peers working in the same sector bearing in mind the said caractheristics of the company. the remuneration of directors with executive variable component that together guarantee a competitive remuneration in the market and which also serve as a motivating element for high individual and collective performance allowing ambitious targets for accelerated growth and the appropriate shareholders remuneration to be set and achieved. erik geilenkirchen holds a masters in mechanical engineering. since 1989 his professional activity has been focused in hr having worked in hay group for nine years and afterwards in ahold group as vp human resources with focus in hr and chief human resources intelligentboardroom. com. jorge ponce de le o

portuguesa was ceo of saip sgps and chairman of the board of directors of ana aeroportos de portugal. to better understand the business and the company s culture and values the members of the remuneration committee had the chance to visit the operations of the group in the several countries where it operates. this was deemed important by this committee to make sure that the remuneration policies and processes of corporate bodies particularly the one of directors with executive duties are effectively aligned with the business strategy and with the rest of the organization. subsection iii remuneration structure 69. description of the remuneration policy of the board of directors and the supervisory board the remuneration committee was of the opinion to the basic principles that have been the core of 3 based on publicly available information and on documents published by specialized 113jer nimo martins 225 years growing remuneration committee taking into account the expected contribution of directors with executive duties to results shareholder value creation eva evolution of share prices the work carried out of achievement of the projects integrated on the group s strategic scorecard as well as the criteria applied in the attribution of variable remuneration to the remaining managers. the remuneration policy continues seeking to reward the directors with executive duties for the sustained performance of the company in the long term and the safeguarding of the interests of the company and shareholders within this period of time. for this reason the variable component takes into account the contribution of the directors with executive duties to the conduct of business namely through the achievement of eva objectives set out in the medium and long term plan approved by the board of directors and the implementation of a series of projects across the by the board of directors as essential to ensure future competitiveness have a time scale that may exceed one calendar year being the directors with executive duties responsible for each compliance stage in the scope of their duties. the variable remuneration is as already noted dependent on predetermined criteria objectives by the remuneration committee which take into consideration the company s real growth the wealth created for shareholders and long term sustainability. bearing in mind the contribution of the several countries and business areas where the group operates to total turnover and consolidated results the remuneration committee considers components of remuneration to directors with executive duties be split amongst the company and its subsidiary companies where such directors are also members of the management body according with a ratio to be determined by this committee. as regards the deferral of part of the variable component of the remuneration the remuneration committee conducted a study on the subject in 2011 without reaching a conclusion about the advantages or inconveniences of its adoption considering that the manner in which the remuneration of the directors with executive duties is structured is adequate and ensures full alignment of their interests with those of the company in the long term. for the same reason the remuneration committee deems unnecessary to determine the maximum potential amount in aggregate and or individual terms of remuneration to be paid to members of corporate bodies. furthermore the committee considers that the remuneration policy of the company is aligned with the remuneration practices of its counterparts within the psi20 bearing in mind the characteristics of the company. the company did not enter into any contracts with its directors which mitigate the risk inherent to the remuneration variability set by the company nor is the same aware that any such contracts have been entered into between its directors and third parties. the absence of a deferral period for the variable component makes it unnecessary to have mechanisms to prevent the execution of contracts by executive directors that subvert the rationale of variable remuneration. the remuneration of the members of the audit committee as well as the remuneration of directors with non executive duties continues to with respect to directors with non executive duties who are part of specialised committees whether or not exclusively composed of directors the remuneration committee considered it appropriate to continue the attribution of meeting fees bearing in mind that the duties performed within those committees demand additional availability from the respective member directors. 3. how we are organised114 of remuneration the fact that the variable real growth of the company the wealth created for shareholders the implementation of projects across the group s companies which ensure the future competitiveness of businesses and long term sustainability cause that management s evaluation is made taking into

with its directors which intend to mitigate the risk inherent to the variability of remuneration set by the company. similarly with respect to directors with non executive duties who take part of supervisory bodies of the company s subsidiaries bearing in mind that such duties arise from the exercise of their functions as directors the remuneration committee considered appropriate to attribute

creation for the shareholders. d as regards recommendation iv. 2. it is important to explain that in 2011 the audit committee established the rules concerning the provision of consultancy services by the external auditor. these rules determine i. the possibility of contracting those services if the auditor s independence is assured and ii. the obligation to obtain prior approval of the said committee from the moment the global amount of fees related to this type of services in that year surpasses 10 of the global amount of fees concerning audit services. the audit committee considers that the provision of non audit services up to the said amount of 10 does not compromise the auditor s independence. furthermore the committee considers this solution as the most appropriate to the group s geographical subsidiaries set up in other jurisdictions. 3. other information there is no other data or additional information which is relevant for understanding the corporate governance

the millions of customers who visit our stores every day we are seriously committed to defend and promote public health through food. furthermore we seek to encourage responsible consumption as a means of also promoting the business sustainability. these priorities arise from observing society s eating habits over recent years and noting that excessive consumption of sugar salt and saturated fats has resulted in an increase in the prevalence of diseases such as obesity diabetes osteoporosis and cardiovascular diseases. for the group being an active agent in the change of these eating habits implies not only promoting healthier lifestyles but also a commitment to investing in the development and more democratic access to nutritionally balanced less processed private brand food needs including intolerance to certain ingredients along with full intuitive nutritional labelling. promoting good health through food is achieved basically using two action strategies complemented by

a more rational use of the energy required. other measures such as the alfena dc began operating in april 2017. with the objective of reducing water and energy consumption the following types of technology were installed thermal solar panels for heating the hot water nursery and changing rooms technology control and regulation of the intensity of the lighting depending on motion detection and or outdoor light heat recovery from the smoke extraction system in the canteen to use for blown air climate control inside the kitchen harnessing of rain water in the returns warehouse for use for

of 1 700 m 3. and regulating sensors for ice machines have also been implemented. the investment in these measures more than 65 million euros in the last four years avoided the emission of over 65 thousand tonnes of carbon and has a return complementary to the technological measures for reducing water and energy consumptions we have been investing in projects to encourage best practices in terms of behaviour. the water and energy consumption management teams a project that began in the stores in portugal in 2011 has achieved a reduction in these consumptions of 357 700 m 3 and 36 565

additionally we ask our suppliers who have products where these origin and the existence of sustainability disclosed in our annual response to the carbon external entity. our goal is to progressively ensure the sustainable origin of these raw materials in line with the commitment to zero net deforestation by 2020 made within the scope of our participation in the consumer goods forum 20. we obtained the following results in 2017 palm oil in 2017 22 956 tonnes were present in the group s private brand products and perishables a reduction of 38 compared to 2014. this reduction is the result of replacing palm oil with vegetable oils with a better out of the total palm oil used about 26 is soy 13 649 tonnes of soy as a direct ingredient were present in the group s private brand products and perishables in 2017. of these 8 215 tonnes are from countries at risk of deforestation 21 a value about six times above the observed in 2014. this increase in soy from countries at risk of deforestation is mostly due to the group s operations expansion in colombia a country with a high consumption of vegetable oils containing soy from bolivia. the group is investing efforts to characterize the agricultural practices adopted by these suppliers. embedded soy e. g. used in animal feed was calculated at 283 667 tonnes e. g. rtrs and proterra these were of less than 1 for direct

same time ensuring that these products whose nutritional are part of the value chain reaching our consumers tables. we do so both by incorporating them in our soups in portugal and in poland or in 4 th range products washed and pre cut vegetables ready to use or by selling them at a reduced price in our recheio stores. in total in 2017 we made sure that over 13 600 tonnes of these products also known as ugly fruit and vegetables were placed on the market an increase of 2 compared to 2016. reduction in the distances that products travel we developed partnerships with our fruit and vegetables suppliers seeking to reduce the environmental impacts associated with the sale of such products. an example is the case of mango production in spain or senegal. these partnerships have production characteristics similar to those of the mangoes produced in brazil but has allowed the distance travelled to be reduced by more than 5 000 km and to substitute air by sea or road transport leading 2 emissions. this partnership also ensures in stores a product of higher quality since the reduction in distance makes it possible to harvest the mango when it is more mature. in 2017 it sold over 47 thousand kilograms of mangoes sourced from these countries. our strategy for supplying certain strategic products through our own production at our company jer nimo martins agro alimentar also means we have greater operational control over the process in the reduction of the distances travelled by the products and subsequent carbon emissions and in the delivery lead time to the store thereby contributing towards greater product quality. such is the case of angus beef and the production of sea bass and gilt head bream through aquaculture which are varieties traditionally produced outside portugal. in 2017 we secured the supply of over 350 tonnes of angus beef and 1 330 kg of sea bass. we aim to progressively increase these quantities we seek to progressively incorporate and

at hl are mainly associated with production. hl aims to ensure safe workplaces with a good working environment by carrying out preventive work including regular updates of safety procedures and examination of di erent risk factors. all major o ces and production facilities have joint management worker health and safety committees. more than 80 percent of the workers have their workplace controlled by a formal joint man agement worker health and safety committee. in 2017 all factory employees at hl s production facilities have undergone health and safety training. at the factory in gliwice in poland there was a tem porary increase in workplace accidents in 2016. this was because production was expanded and new production processes were added while the proportion of temporary sta increased. this resulted in a series of measures in 2017. among other things a major focus was placed on increasing the proportion of permanent employees in the workforce to 80 percent. at the same time induction training for new employees has been enhanced. a new more comprehensive training package related to work place health and safety was also prepared. the measures have had the intended e ect which meant that the number of injuries decreased considerably in 2017. the number of workplace accidents leading to absence or sick leave in the group in 2017 was 7 2016 26. of the 7 2 were women and 5 men. no fatal accidents occurred. hl sustainability report 2017 8 14in 2016 hl began work on digitisation of processes in the area of human resources. in 2017 this work has continued and

position in its areas of operation. this in turn places demands on employees skills and abilities as it is ultimately their expertise motivation and drive that enables hl to continuously strengthen its market position. it is therefore a key task for hl to create the right conditions for employees to develop and feel committed to the company. established process for performance appraisals hl has had an established process for helping employees to develop for many years. the process consists of annual performance appraisals in which employees receive constructive feedback on their work together with clear goals de ned jointly by the employee and their immediate supervisor. this also includes a development plan including training needs with future development steps to be taken and career planning. a mid year review takes place after six months in which the individual goals and development plan are followed up. digital system for human resources hl uses a dedicated hr system to facilitate performance appraisal implementation both for employees and managers. the system also ensures that documentation which may contain sensitive data can be handled in a safe and correct manner. employees also have constant access to their own information through the system and can go back and follow up on agreed goals and the development steps to be taken. the fact that the process is fully digital also facilitates monitoring for senior managers who for example can easily check that all employees have completed the annual performance appraisal. as a further check all employees were asked whether they had undergone a scheduled performance appraisal in the annual employee survey that the company conducts and 90 percent scored positive. further development in digitising the hr processes in 2017 have added the process of determining compensation and bene ts to employees as well as additional analysis tools. employee engagement survey in 2017 hl has continued to develop its employee engage ment survey. the survey is fully digital and employees who do not use computers in their daily work are able to access tablets to participate in the survey. the response rate was 90 percent which is high compared to other companies with a large part of the sta working in production. the survey is closely linked to the company strategy and covers four areas e ciency leadership engagement and sustainable work life. based on the results hl will prioritise and implement improvements that strengthen the company s position as an employer and support e orts to achieve the company s goals. in addition to the results at company level results are shared with and owned by each local manager and about 100 managers have received their own results for their teams. based on the results they take local measures which are monitored aimed at improving their business. the survey generated group wide actions such as internal communications and training. learning at work hl is working continuously on further training of employees to ensure they are well equipped for success in their work. examples include continuous product training for sales personnel at the company where the company s product managers organise local training for the sales force as well as operations teams around the world. in addition global sales trainings for key account managers and account executives are held twice a year. in 2017 hl introduced a new onboarding program for new employees who work internationally and in positions with many contacts with various parts of the hl organisation. the introductory program is held in sweden and both the ceo and other members of group management participate in giving employees a deep understanding of the company s strategies and objectives. in order to further emphasise hl s strategy and create commitment to the company s chosen path forward the company has also set up a leadership forum which is a cross function meeting held twice a year. it is aimed primarily at the company s top managers such as regional and factory managers who also receive presentation materials to be used and distributed in their own organisations.

related to plastic waste use of plastic raw materials and use of water and energy. the company has a presence in approximately 50 markets either direct or through distributors which means that shipments of products represent a source of environmental impact. hl also de nes environmental requirements for its suppliers in the company s purchasing policy. suppliers must guarantee that they comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations in the country where they operate. they must also sign a written undertaking regarding reach the eu s chemicals legislation. hl s major suppliers are large international producers of plastic raw materials which have their own comprehen sive environmental programmes in place. iso 14001 certi cation an on going process in compliance with the iso 14001 environmental management standard is an important part of hl s e orts to continuously improve its environmental performance. within the framework of working with iso 14001 several important parameters that in uence the company s environmental performance are monitored annually. as of 2017 the production facilities in sundsvall in sweden gliwice in poland and suzhou in china have iso 14001 certi cations meaning that 75 percent of hl s production facilities are certi ed. the facility in harlow uk remains to be certi ed and it is hl s aim that this will be done as soon as it is practicable. raw materials hl s main raw material is plastic notably pvc. see graph to the left for more details about raw materials use. several projects related to raw materials were launched in 2017. ivl swedish environmental research institute con ducted a lifecycle analysis of hl s products from cradle to grave. by clearly establishing the current situation it will be easier for hl to ensure that the company s develop ment choices such as the use of recycled materials or the development of brand new materials will result in the desired improvements from a sustainability perspective. today hl o ers customers products within both extrusion and injection moulding with 20 percent recycled material which reduces environmental impact by 10 percent according to the lifecycle analysis. in 2017 hl also begun production of products made with plastics that are starch based instead of oil based so called pla materials and thereby biodegradable. the products are now being tested in stores in sweden and finland. the new materials have been developed as part of a close collaboration between hl and kth the royal institute of technology stockholm that started in january 2017. hl complies with reach the eu s chemicals legislation and this is considered in the company s approval of new materials. pvc 31. 7 42. 5 pet 15. 6 19. 8 polystyrene ps 3. 2 3. 5 abs 2. 9

sustainability report 2017 10 14waste management the waste generated at hl s factories consists largely of plastics. hl addresses the problem of waste in production in two ways. the rst is to reduce plastic waste generated in production by streamlining production processes where possible. the second is to recycle plastic and other waste as far as possible. it is also hl s aim to use plastic waste directly in its own production both its own waste and waste material from external sources. during the year the company invested in production equipment at the gliwice factory which makes it possible to reuse plastic waste from the production processes in new products. the recycled material is blended with virgin material to ensure strength of the products. similar solutions are in use at the factory in sundsvall sweden. hl s goal is that all waste from production will eventually be recyclable. total waste at the company s production facilities in 2017 was 2 187 tonnes 2016 2 057 tonnes and 90. 2 percent of this was recycled 2016 94. 5 percent. energy consumption hl s direct electricity consumption in production was 25. 8 gwh in 2017 2016 25. 5 gwh. 43 percent of hl s energy consumption comes from renewable sources and as an example hl s sundsvall factory runs entirely on hydrogenerated electricity. various measures for reducing electricity consumption are being implemented at the factories. these range from heating the premises using waste heat from machinery to installing time controlled lighting. water usage in production is primarily related to the cooling of extruded and injection moulded plastic products. hl s factory in gliwice uses a closed cooling water system for injection moulding to reduce water consumption. during the year preparatory work has been initiated to investigate new opportunities to signi cantly reduce water consumption at the sundsvall factory. in 2017 367 499 m of water municipal water supplies were used at the group s production facilities 2016 367 000 m . transport hl engages third party suppliers for its transport and requires these suppliers to have environmental pro grammes in place. the majority of shipments are by truck for example from the european factories to the european hubs and from the hubs to the customers. sea transport is the primary shipping method for ready made goods from asia and the usa as well as for tools bought in asia for use in the european factories. hl constantly endeavours to improve transport e ciency by increasing the number of products per package and reducing package size. the ability for a product to be e ciently packaged is taken into consideration already in the product development phase. the company s eet of vehicles it is hl s aim to gradually reduce co emissions from its eet of vehicles. the company has four di erent categories of vehicles and there are limits on co emissions for each category. these limits are reviewed every 12 18 months to see if they can be lowered. the upper limit for carbon dioxide emissions is 125 g km. respect for the environment in all operations hl endeavours to promote a high level of environmental awareness in everyday activities at its o ces around the world. this means collecting and sorting paper packag ing material and old electronic equipment and ensuring they are sent for recycling. hl has been using telephone and video conferences as an alternative to travel between o ces for many years now. with technological development and the launch of services such as skype google hangout and others the use of video conferencing at hl has increased further. this means lower travel costs for the company and a reduction in the environmental impacts of business travel. waste management metric ton total plastic metal

principles principle 10 businesses should work against corruption in all its forms including extortion and bribery. credibility sound ethical values and regulatory compliance are essential for hl to be a preferred partner to its customers and continue to develop successfully. hl s code of conduct demonstrates the company s strong position against corruption. the company will maintain a good reputation for honesty integrity and taking responsibility. this means that hl will not tolerate involvement in bribery extortion or corruption in any form. measures to counter corruption hl has well developed management systems and struc tures for nancial monitoring and reporting. these are key tools to in daily work minimise the risk of irregularities and corruption in the business. the regulatory framework instructions for authorities decisions and approvals represents an important tool for combating irregularities in the business. it contains clearly documented rules that govern the authority of employees at di erent levels in the company and how decisions are to be made and approvals given in the group. in 2017 all employees who have contract negotiations in their duties have undergone training in contractual law. the training focused on all aspects of contracts from an economic as well as a contractual and ethical per spective. measures also include that all new employees in 2017 had the code of conduct which contains clear rules of practice regarding corruption explained to them. all employees in hl have signed the code of conduct thereby agreeing to comply with it. clear guidelines on business ethics are also included in the purchasing policy that all suppliers must sign. corruption a risk area the risk analyses that hl has conducted previously have identi ed corruption as a risk area for the company. risks are mainly associated with purchases made in local markets. the risk of corruption also exists in customer relationships. hl operates in some risk markets where some parties may try to facilitate deals by making direct payments to individuals in the client company. increased centralisation and control of purchasing activities plays an important part in the company s anti corruption e orts. any local suppliers that hl wishes to engage in the regions must be validated centrally. this ensures that the prices and other terms are in line with the company s other collaborations. under the local purchasing procedures the individual placing a purchase order is not the one who identi es and selects a supplier. in the selling activity agreed prices are entered into hl s erp system. invoicing and customer payments relating to each order are controlled by the company s back o ce function and are separate from eld sales. hl did not have any corruption related incidents that led to disciplinary action in 2017 2016 0. anti corruption hl sustainability report 2017 12 14gri standard disclosure page reference commentstandard

a general practice at aspirations education to uphold the internatio nally accepted human rights of all stakeholders. all operations are conducted in an ethical manner that support and protect the rights and interests of all human beings as set out in the univer sal declaration of human rights our core business is based on the right to education article 26 universal declaration of human rights

local universities mainly due to lack of placement capacity. this compels students who can afford to look for higher education options in universities and institutes abroad and going overseas for further education has become increasingly common practice among the student population of sri lanka but unfortunately most of them are greatly hampered or misinformed due to a lack of proper channels to disseminate relevant and accurate information. this at times had lead to frustration despai r and disillusionment of both students and their parents. further some of these credulous students become victims of unscrupulous elements who are on the lookout to thrive at their expense. it is at this crucial juncture in our country aspirations educat ion has placed great value in committing resources and effort in our enterprise to provide genuine career guidance and counseling to students keeping their interests and aspirations at heart carrying out this all important mission of giving hope to a

age nationality or disability supporting labour standard s in the international labour organization s declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work aspirations in its sphere of influence goes a step further to to eliminate child labour by helping students to realize the right to education. in this regard aspirations education has launched the apeksha scholarship programme to help

districts had been sustained by monthly scholarships. they would be receiving the monthly payment until their school career comes to an end provided they maintain reasonable academic standards. this

endangered species. 86 exe cutive letter s integr ati ng su staina bility perfor manc e peo ple plan et app end ix lenovo s commitment to protecting the environment came prior to its establishment as a global company with the acquisition of the ibm pc division in 2005. lenovo had already developed technical speci cations for pcs that included environmental attributes such as energy ef ciency. in addition all commercial products were designed to meet china s energy saving targets. with the globalization of lenovo s reach the company took environmental sustainability a step further in 2005 by adopting a comprehensive environmentally conscious products program aimed toward leadership in the global pc business. the program is implemented by a network of environmentally conscious product engineers and green product teams within each business unit and is supported by the global environmental affairs team. 5. 3. 1 p rodu ct m ateria ls5. 3. 1. 1 use of recycled plastics laying the groundwork with post industrial recycled content after lenovo s purchase of ibm s pc division in may of 2005 our initial use of recycled content plastics was achieved with post industrial content pic plastics in the molding of thinkpad bottom covers and thinkcentre and workstation bezels. in some cases these materials were also used to manufacture select internal parts e. g. card stiffeners. this success was critical in gaining the con dence of lenovo product development teams and suppliers in using engineered recycled content plastics and overcoming the misconception that these materials were inferior. the key to lenovo s success in this area was in selecting quality pic sources and working with the plastics manufacturers and compounders to engineer pic recycled plastics with equivalent properties and performance to that of the prime material targeted for replacement. one mistake or failure would have severely damaged future chances of success so each pic recycled material went through extensive quali cations and an application selection process to ensure an acceptable match. from may 2005 to year end 2009 lenovo suppliers used over 1. 5 million net pounds of pic recycled plastics in the manufacture of lenovo products resulting in a number of environmental bene ts. based on this success lenovo and selected pic recycled plastic suppliers began to develop and qualify new grades of recycled plastics with post consumer content pcc plastics in 2007. lenovo continued to use pic recycled plastics until the end of 2011 but their use in lenovo products rapidly declined as quali ed pcc recycled plastics became available and lenovo s product development teams began to use these environmentally preferred materials to satisfy corporate environmental objectives and targets meet new customer requirements and achieve epeat gold registrations for our products. using these engineered plastics not only saves the natural resources and energy that would have gone into manufacturing new plastics but also diverts both pcc and pic from land lls. these environmental bene ts are achieved while still creating a product that meets lenovo s high performance standards. continued improvement in recycled content usage newly released products that meet epeat pcc usage thresholds 10 percent or greater include the thinkvision lt1953 31. 5 percent thinkpad edge e435 and e535 12 percent thinkcentre m78 sff 43 percent and the thinkstation c30 workstations 10 percent. additionally pcc material use has been implemented and or planned in a number of select thinkpad and

products program 5. 387 exe cutive letter s integr ati ng su staina bility perfor manc e peo ple plan et app end ix to overcome the continuing challenges of using recycled content in the design and manufacture of pc plus products especially notebooks tablets and smartphones lenovo s team of engineers works closely with our pcc suppliers to develop and qualify new grades of plastic resins previously unavailable to the it industry. using pcc in it products presents signi cant challenges due to the unique structural performance and cosmetic requirements associated with these applications. depending on the nal application requirements the plastic resins contain between 10 percent and 85 percent pcc. some plastic resins also contain up to 20 percent pic. all of these materials receive environmental and performance quali cations prior to their approval and use in lenovo product applications. recycled content usage to date since early 2005 lenovo has used over 109 million pounds gross of plastic materials containing pcc and or pic in its products with net pcc of over 42. 7 million pounds and net pic of over 1. 8 million pounds. in 2012 lenovo used nearly 23. 2 million pounds gross of recycled plastics with net pcc of over 11 million pounds. to continue this momentum lenovo challenged its product teams to incorporate some amount of pcc into every pc product released by the end of scal year march 2013 and increase each business unit s use of pcc by 10 percent year to year. to encourage the focus of lenovo s product groups on achieving the objective of increasing the use of these environmentally preferred materials and to re ect the maturation of this program the following new targets were established for scal year 2012 13 100 percent of products released after march 31 2013 will contain at least 5 percent pcc relative to total plastics weight. increase the percentage of pcc relative to total plastics weight by 10 percent for all new products released after march 31 2013. the percentage increase is measured relative to the previous generation of the product. in cy 2012 lenovo used 23 248 922 pounds gross of recycled content plastics with

to consider certain environmentally conscious design practices to facilitate and encourage recycling and minimize resource consumption. some examples include all product lines adhere to the marking of plastic parts greater than 25 grams for identi cation of resins for recycling. products are designed to minimize the types of plastics they contain and avoid contamination of plastics by paints glues or welded connections. tools needed for disassembly to subsystem levels are also universally available. product speci c upgradeability features are described in product literature and declarations for all lenovo product lines. recycled resins ranging in recycled content from 10 percent to over 85 percent are used in a number of lenovo hardware applications and are speci ed as preferred materials where practical. lenovo is working toward the goal of including some amount of recycled plastic in all new products. new products are evaluated for chemical emissions. to minimize potential volatile organic compound voc emissions non solvent based powder coatings are used for decorative painted parts wherever practical. lenovo supports a precautionary approach ensuring that appropriate actions are taken even if cause and effect relationships are not fully scienti cally established. lenovo s priority is to use environmentally preferable materials whenever applicable. in adhering to the precautionary approach lenovo supports restricting the intentional addition of potentially concerning materials when economically and technically viable alternatives exist. these restrictions may also include implementing concentration limits for incidental occurrences. for materials where economically and technically viable alternatives do not exist lenovo collects data on the usage of these materials above the de ned concentration limit. this data can then be reported to customers or other stakeholders. lenovo continues to actively search for environmentally preferable materials that can be used as substitutes. we also expect our partners and suppliers to demonstrate the same commitment to environmentally sound practices. our supplier speci cations are available at http www. lenovo.

pvc bfr in all mechanical plastic parts such as external covers housings etc. across all lenovo product lines. lenovo currently prohibits the following from intentional addition to any lenovo parts polybrominated biphenyls pbbs polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes deca brominated diphenyl ethers lenovo has also made signi cant progress in phasing out halogen in many commodities across several product lines. for example all plastic enclosures most components and connectors with the exception of printed board laminates all mechanical plastic parts such as product covers housings bezels etc. and many hard disk drives optical disk drives solid state drives lcd screens memory cpus chipsets communication cards and other commodities have offerings that meet the inemi de nition of low halogen. lenovo plans to release additional bfr and pvc free models across the think and idea family of products as acceptable alternative materials become available working toward the goal to phase out the use of these materials across all newly introduced products. we continue to work with our suppliers to pilot new bfr and pvc free applications. lenovo recognizes that the phase out of these materials is dependent upon the availability of suitable alternatives that meet lenovo s technological quality environmental health and safety requirements. lenovo has identi ed a list of materials and substances of environmental interest. these substances may be candidates for further restrictions in the future. lenovo holds suppliers accountable for reporting the use of these materials through supplier material declarations using the industry standard ipc 1752 form for con rmation of compliance to the restrictions and for reporting when substances in question are above the speci ed concentration levels. we have made it a point to inform customers about the environmental attributes of our products and compliance with applicable laws and regulations through the presentation of a completed industry standard it eco declaration annex b of ecma 370 4th edition june 2009. declarations for newly released products are posted on lenovo s environmental website at http www. lenovo. com ecodeclaration. consistent with our precautionary approach we continuously analyze the regulatory environment and consider input from our customers nongovernmental organizations ngos and other stakeholders in evaluating the potential health and environmental impacts of our products. we weigh these inputs to determine the restricted substances as well as the substances of interest to be tracked for the purpose of reporting and for the consideration of future restrictions. 5. 3. 2 p rodu ct e ner gy eff iciency the ict industry has been driving huge productivity gains for decades and

initiative successfully launched in 2015 with over 125 managers attending the two day event in ve locations across the santa fe network. the programme is designed to give line managers more con dence in successfully completing day to day managerial activities including performance management providing feedback and coaching understanding team dynamics and action centred leadership as well as motivation and engagement. further programmes are planned throughout 2016 in an effort to ensure that the majority of line managers in particular rst time managers and those managers new to the organisation appreciate the fundamental principles of leading others and getting the best out of their teams. enhancing our learning platform we offer online learning opportunities to all of our employees. in an era of information overload it is vital that we help employees easily access the most relevant targeted content and courses that will enable them to develop the capabilities they need to succeed. in 2015 we nalised our plan to move our learning management system lms to a single platform within our hr management system hris that will enhance individual experience while allowing us to better measure learning outcomes. our new hris pulse was implemented across our entire organisation in 2015. it will allow us to develop capabilities on a global scale in a more integrated fashion share training content more easily design curriculum that incorporates multiple modes of learning and provide a more customised experience for individual learners. overall the course catalogue will be targeted toward the most current relevant and in demand skills and content. for our employees the learning experience will be a much more personal one. one of our core people initiatives in 2015 was the implementation of our rst ever global employee engagement survey. we are partnering with the great place to work institute on this strategic people project and are already embracing the feedback from our employees by running local focus groups and getting a better understanding of the working environment we need to create to foster a culture of trust at all levels. 77 of all employees took part in the survey and while there is some work to do we have a number of markets with outstanding results. culture change is a marathon not a sprint and we know that it will take time. however we are proud of having started this important engagement initiative and are already looking forward to our october 2016 survey. 2016 will also be the year in which a globally consistent approach to performance management is introduced across santa fe. not only have we introduced consistent metrics for our senior leaders we are also supporting the roll out of the process through an online performance management system which ties seamlessly into our existing hris and lms creating a compelling overall online bundle for our employees. in order to ensure performance management has a positive impact we will only request the top two levels of the organisation to complete this year s process from 2017 it will be cascaded further. the process has been designed with constant feedback in mind e. g. monthly 1 on 1 meetings between managers and employees to update one another on performance against objectives. this will reduce the potential ambiguity and stresses often caused by formal mid year and year end review cycles as employees will have received on going feedback throughout the year. as a global company our employees contractors clients and suppliers come from diverse backgrounds and cultures. by valuing diversity and equal opportunity we connect with the richest spectrum of experiences skills expertise and perspectives for all of the markets we serve. this philosophy is also re ected in our own recruiting process we recognise that a diverse workforce fosters creativity innovation and better business practices. diversity santa fe continues to monitor gender ratio to ensure that we are an attractive employer to both male and female prospective employees as well as our current employees. the overall female gender ratio increased this was attributed to the increase of female employees at the of ce staff level. in accordance with its support to un global compact and in line with its long running practices santa fe group endeavours to create equal opportunities for employees and managers regardless of gender ethnicity age political and religious convictions etc. pursuant to danish legislation on gender equality santa fe also has an objective for the proportion of the underrepresented gender on the board of directors. it is santa fe s ambition that 25 of the members of the board of directors are women. consequently santa fe will ensure that qualitied candidates are considered before the board of directors proposes candidates to the annual general meeting. however the board of directors nal submission of candidates will always be based on their actual competencies and experiences relative to santa fe s needs to ensure that the candidate deemed best quali ed is proposed. in 2015 1 of 4 members 25 of the santa fe board of directors was a woman. following the transformation of santa fe in 2015 with a generational handover in executive management and the launch of a new strategy towards 2020 the board of directors also wishes to ensure that the composition of the board forms the best possible support for the future journey. this may mean that the ambition of a 25 female representation on the board of directors will not be met at all times but it will continue to be a general ambition. employee retention retaining employees remains an important aspect of our business our goal is to remain an attractive employer respecting supporting and adhering to internationally proclaimed human rights including the basic principles of the international labour organisation s declaration of fundamental principles and rights at work. our absolute turnover was 23. 3 with higher turnover rates being seen in australia mainly due to restructuring of the organisation. our goal is to bring the absolute turnover to 20 health safety we take appropriate measures to provide a safe working environment for all of our employees contractors and consultants. we focus on compliance with health and safety legislation within our own business operations and also apply this same standard as a matter of priority. we recognise the importance of work life balance and appreciate the value that out of work activities bring back into the workplace. we also aim to foster a culture of well being by providing a variety of tools education and resources that reinforce healthy lifestyle choices. in the eld of occupational health and safety both the number of accidents with time lost and the number of lost workdays per accident increased in 2015. these were mainly due to work accidents involving operational staff undertaking manual labour. we aim to reduce the number of work accidents and associated days lost in 2016 by continuing with the integration of health and safety considerations in decision making processes along with more training cooperation and improved coordination across the organisation. people health safety continued 10facts on people gender ratio absolute turnover work accidents with days lost 0811total

our success not just in our business operations but also in our drive to improve environmental performance. as a result they are fully involved in our environmental programmes as part of our csr programme. at a local in 2015 the environmental committee in france undertook a number of environmental initiatives to raise employee awareness and collaborate efforts to reduce their environmental impact. these initiatives ranged from placing recycling boxes in the kitchen for recycling coffee capsules to setting up a compost bin and improving the paper recycling process. santa fe s environmental policy is intended to be sustainable and is being integrated into our day to day business practices. as such this policy is communicated to all staff members and is also available to the public. santa fe applies recognised environmental management systems such as iso 14001 2004 or its local equivalent based on the principle of continuous performance improvement. these systems are the basis for the deployment of key elements which include risk analysis monitoring of environmental performance and compliance to regulations and permits follow up of the corresponding corrective actions review of performance and improvement plans by the management. our objectives are to reduce our impact on the environment year on year by becoming more energy ef cient thereby reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. minimising our waste by applying a reduce reuse recycle philosophy. our business has environmental impacts from the packing material we purchase and their disposal. with a eet of over 540 vehicles we acknowledge this as being a huge environmental consideration for santa fe. our vision and goals focus on reducing our impacts at each stage of our value chain and making a positive difference to the world in which we live. a key achievement in 2015 was santa fe hong kong s award for environmental excellence. the hong kong of ce successfully won the transport and logistics certi cate of merit awarded by the environmental campaign committee ecc. this was in recognition of the efforts to promote environmental practices and management. we pride ourselves on being a responsible organisation and have committed to continually improving our environmental performance and preventing pollution. we support and comply with all environmental legislation and advocate a precautionary approach with regard to environmental concerns. 1410reducing our environmental footprint continued waste our reduce reuse recycle philosophy has led to some positive recycling results in the past three years. 2015 saw a reduction in the amount of waste recycled which can be attributed to a signi cant amount of available waste that was recycled in 2014. there was a signi cant reduction of 48. 7 in the amount of waste sent to land ll however there was an increase of 14. 7 of waste incinerated. in 2016 we aim to recycle 75 of all available waste and reduce the amount of waste sent to land ll by 2. this can be achieved by placing an even greater emphasis on the importance of recycling providing awareness training for employees as well as the resources and systems in place to maximise our recycling potential. reduce santa fe s household goods services continues to be heavily reliant on natural resources in particular materials such as paper cardboard plastic etc. santa fe australia has successfully made the transition to using envirowrap a material based alternative to cardboard packaging which reduces the amount of cardboard and tape used during packing for intra country moves. the mass of materials used per household goods move continues to decrease and can be attributed to various initiatives such as educating packers on ef cient packing density packing and using the original manufacturers packaging where available. reuse santa fe has looked at a number of opportunities for reusing packing material these have ranged from being donated to help local charities aiding with local relief work being re used on household goods moves where the quality and integrity of the packing material has not been compromised. recycle santa fe london has a partnership programme with their packing supplier where all waste is collected and recycled back into packing material. this has been a great initiative and seen positive results with 0 of waste being sent to land ll. santa fe has a number of initiatives surrounding recycling such as recycling bins made available for of ce paper tin cans and printer cartridges as well as for packaging material. technology microsoft sharepoint 2010 yammer technology and skype for business is revolutionising the ways we communicate and at santa fe we also recognise the need for technology that is environmentally friendly. following on from the initial rollout of skype for business which offers messaging voice and video calling capabilities and enables people to communicate remotely we extended this offering in 2015 to include yammer the enterprise social networking software. everyone at santa fe now has this software installed. it has created a new communication platform for our business. our investment in these technologies has enabled teams who work remotely to meet virtually capturing nancial savings ensuring better work life balance for colleagues in international roles and reducing our carbon footprint. energy the amount of electricity consumed in 2015 decreased by 0. 89 this result can be attributed to creating and maintaining sustainable warehouses and also continuous management and awareness building with all our employees globally. trucks as we grow and increase sales and delivery of our services we continue to look for ways to increase the ef ciency and reduce emissions levels of our eet. many of these initiatives have required no additional investment by promoting the choice of lower emission models for our eets continuously improve the way in which they are maintained and how their routes and volumes are scheduled. this has resulted in a 0. 14 decrease in fuel per tonnage moved. greenhouse gas emissions santa fe has continued to monitor its ghg emissions. we continue to work with our of ces globally to improve the data quality to allow better and more in depth reporting of our scope 1 2 and 3 ghg emissions. fuel continues to be santa fe s biggest contributor to its

scope 3 ghg emissions. one of our objectives for 2015 was to collect data from our australian of ces to provide a better indication of our overall relevant scope 3 ghg emissions impact. we are pleased

uence our business in many ways we would like to also see our role as actively working to shape the future of some of these global issues. we are uniquely placed to do so. we are starting to evaluate the kind of scenarios these issues will present over the next 20 30 years. and we are forming our response accordingly. economic development and trade global economic output has developed rapidly alongside population growth. between 1990 and 2010 global gdp has grown from usd 25 trillion to usd 75 trillion . an important element within this eco nomic growth is that patterns of trade are shifting from the developed world to emerging economies. in the last ve years emerging markets have been responsible for 80 of gdp growth and overall represent half of all gdp compared to a third 30 years ago 4. trade between emerging economies is also a growing trend with trade between brics nations growing from usd 21. 6 billion in 2001 to usd 154. 5 billion in 2009 5. in the last 50 years international trade in manufactured goods has increased over 100 times from usd 95 billion to usd 12 trillion 6. containerisation has helped accelerate this trade growth. today around 90 of global trade uses sea transport 7. maersk line is the biggest shipping line in the in dustry. we play a signi cant role in the global marketplace connecting custom ers with new markets. trade shifts demand change we expect the volume of goods moving continue to increase. simultaneously raw materials from latin america oceania and africa will increase to supply asian manufacturing industries. as the gdp of countries on these continents rises the returning trade ow will also grow. asia will become an increasingly impor tant customer as well as a producer. intra asian trade will therefore increase signi cantly. e shipping industry has a major role to play in supporting these trade ows and making sure they are managed e ectively. we will need to partner with governments ports and customers to ensure that infrastruc ture and capaci bottlenecks do not hamper prosperi and cause unwanted impacts. economic development and poverty is recent history of global economic development has created signi cant bene ts particularly in the alleviation of pover. it has taken china only 20 years 1991 2010 to double its average per capita income from usd 2 000 to usd 4 260 and india only 10 years to increase its per capita income from usd 329 in 1991 to usd 1 265 in 2010 8. the global middle class grew to 1. 8 billion people between 1980 and 2009 an increase of 700 million and is anticipated to grow by 3 billion more in the next 20 years 9. exports growth and access to global markets help raise the living standards of many people but many economies are still held back by pover and a lack of healthcare and education. the environment and natural resource constraints it is impossible to talk about economic development without recognising the signi cant consequences this has already had and will continue to have for the environment and the amount of natural resources available on the planet. for our industry and the means by which we will support global trade most e ectively. for example increasingly unbalanced trade ows will challenge the utilisation of ships if some exports cannot be paired with a returning load thus resulting in emp backhauls and logistical waste. shipping lines are constantly looking to optimise shipments to avoid emp capaci. capaci optimisation will become increasingly important to maintain high energy e ciency per container in global shipping. food and

challenges are severe it is also true that leading businesses and other players are starting to re think the role of business in socie and how they can help provide viable solutions. it is exciting to follow the developments of many global organisations including some of our biggest customers who are revising their business models to improve what are seen as systemic rather than industry speci c challenges. we welcome this development and want to play our part in it. similar to our customers we recognise that we are unable to tackle the issues in isolation. collaboration and partnerships are forming across sectors across industries and between public and private sectors. we too are seeking ways to collaborate and examples include our participation with the world economic forum sus tainable shipping initiative and innova tive programmes with customers where the objective is the optimisation of supply chains and creation of shared value. it makes sense for us to take the lead in our industry given our size position and support of the a. p. moller maersk group. our operations require large scale investments often spanning 25 30 years. our investments need to generate value for the long term and on many di erent parameters. it is this outlook for long term economic growth and shared value along with our commit ment to drive industry wide change that makes us uniquely positioned to be part of a solution. sustainability progress report 2011 maersk line route 210about the report is is the second sustainabili pro gress report from maersk line. it re ports on the

business from the ceo i am pleased to present you with maersk line s second sustainabili progress report. it provides a snap shot of our performance in 2011 and the work we have done to improve our services and overall nancial social and environmental performance. even though maersk line is more com petitive and responsive to customer needs than ever we faced a significant nancial loss in 2011. on top of relentless turbulence in the global economy overcapaci and the downward trend in freight rates put pressure on our bottom line result. overall the global liner shipping industry faces some fundamental challenges. it is not pro table. it is extremely volatile. and it is to a large extent still perceived as a commodi business. at needs to change. at maersk line we have set out to transform liner shipping. e launch of daily maersk was an important milestone in 2011. we will continue to innovate our products and services to help our customers optimise their supply chains and save cost. today the environmental impact of running our eet of 600 container ships is signi cant in absolute terms. it is a challenge we do not take lightly. in 2011 our absolute air emissions increased with the expansion of our eet. improving our energy e ciency is key to reduce our impact and we are building on solid performance. since 2007 we have reduced our co footprint per container by 15. 6. introducing route 2 industry specific challenges and pressing global issues such as climate change population growth and food securi demand important change in the way we and many of our customers operate. business as usual is not an option. our view of a more sustainable future and the actions to get there are captured under the heading route 2. is is our way of suggesting that there is a better alternative one that is both pro table and sustainable. i am proud of how much maersk line has achieved over the last year. i would particularly like to highlight the following to you maersk line improved customers supply chains by providing the most reliable shipping services in the industry at a lower environmental footprint per container compared both to the industry average and our own 2010 performance levels. maersk line s fuel switch programme reduced sulphur emissions by 65 zealand and sweden. maersk line became a safer place to work with relatively fewer accidents. we

port pro ductivi in west africa the waf max vessels help reduce important barriers for continued trade growth in the region. africa rising africa s economy is growing rapidly. over the past decade six of the world s ten fastest growing countries were african and in the period 2011 2015 seven of the top 10 fastest growing economies will be in africa. west africa stands out in this respect. in 2011 ghana s economy was predicted to be the fastest growing in the been around 9 during the last 10 years. 11signi cant challenges remain for africa as large inequalities continue to persist in income and human development. while economic growth is likely to reduce the proportion of the population living on less than usd 1. 25 a day the african development bank estimates that pov er will remain a fact of life for around a third of the people living in africa for the next 40 years. e bank concludes that africa needs a long term average of 7 annual gdp growth across the continent for pover to decline signi cantly. barriers to growth in west africa ports and container ter minals are among the least e cient and most congested in the world. dwell times the time between a container is discharged from a vessel and till it exits the port facilities are nearly quadruple those of asian ports 12. low port productivi contributes to high trade cost and in ated pricing of consumer goods. transportation and logistics costs in west africa are in fact among the highest in the world and imported goods are out of reach for many west african consumers. at the same time the economy continues to be heavily dependent on commodity exports of oil and mineral reserves resulting in a signi cant out ow of empty containers. ultimately the west african population bears the costs of the current system and its ine ciencies. introducing wafmax in response to the trade growth between far east asia and west africa maersk line is upgrading its services to west africa by introducing 22 new container ships from 2011 13. e wafmax ves sels are the biggest container vessels to ever serve the region. ey can carry 4 500 containers teu and have been designed speci cally to accommodate the lower drafts in west african ports and enable a more e cient operation. the wafmax e ect on port and terminal operations e wafmax vessels will support im portant ports and terminal operators in tema in ghana in increasing their capacity and turnaround times. by reducing vessels waiting time in the ports and enabling faster discharging and loading of containers the wafmax vessels will enable speedier trade ows in and out of west africa at a lower cost for all stake holders involved. as the majori of the container ships currently calling west african ports are relatively small in size between 1 700 2 500 teu and unable to meet the spe ci c conditions of the ports the waiting time spent getting in and out of west african ports is signi cant. besides delivering almost twice the number of containers in one vessel call the physical dimensions of the waf max vessels along with an automated container lock feature enables faster discharge of containers and can provide a safer working environment for port stevedores. improvements still needed important challenges remain to be addressed in order for west african communities to bene t from the full wafmax e ect. among other things this includes overcoming the current capaci constraints in west african ports to meet future growth making the customs declaration processes more e cient and transparent improving and expanding the inland transportation network and upgrading the logistics planning capabilities of the many small to medium sized west african businesses. the environmental and human health impacts while environmental pollution and emis sions from trade remains a peripheral pri ori for many people living in west africa environmental impacts of trade are not negligible and a signi cant share of this derives from maritime transportation. one major pollutant from shipping is sul phur dioxide causing acidi cation and impacting the health of the people who live close to ports. e port of apapa is located within 2 km of the ci centre of lagos and the port of tema is located ap proximately 5 km from the ci centre of tema. more than 12 million people live within a radius of 25 km of the two ports. due to the port productivi bene ts and the increased e ciency of the wafmax vessels sulphur emissions will decrease by 20 in apapa and 13 in tema from 2013 onwards. while of a more global nature co emis sions from shipping on the far east asia west africa trade are also signi cant. west african customers using the waf max vessels will however be able to reduce co emissions of their goods by up to 30 compared to the industry average. 11 international monetary fund 12 harding p lssonand raballand 2007 better trade better trade sustainability progress report 2011 maersk line route 225sustainability progress

down shipping inventory and con gestion costs by usd 131 million per year in apapa and usd 80 million per year in tema to the bene t of shipping lines and west african importers and exporters. increased trade potential increased trade is a key vehicle of gdp growth and a necessary condition for pover alleviation in west africa. based on the estimated increase in port productivi the wafmax has a poten tial to increase trade ows by usd 760 million usd 490 million per year in ghana by 2013. reduced environmental footprint increased trade in and out of west africa means increased emissions of both local and global pollutants. e introduction of wafmax will reduce absolute sul phur dioxide emissions in the ports by 20 per year in apapa and 13 per year in tema compared to a situation without wafmax. furthermore the wafmax vessels will have a 30 lower co foot print per container moved compared to the industry average on that trade. catalysts for trade and economic growth in west africa in 2011 container volumes between far east asia and west africa grew by 25 mainly due to large gdp growth in ghana. in comparison container volumes grew by approximately 6 between europe and west africa. for the coming 1 2 years growth in container volumes are expected to continue but at more moderate levels due to lower economic growth in west africa with an estimated 9 in 2012 and 5 in 2013. china s need for resources and commod ities is a key driver of increased trade flows between far east asia and west africa along with growing demand for lower priced chinese products in growing west african markets such as ghana west african ports and terminal op erators face one of the most chal lenging environments in the world negatively impacting their efficiency. by 2013 wafmax will

between maersk line and the receiving ports and terminals in west africa. examples of joint e orts include training of pilots and stevedores along with careful stowage planning to ensure that the vessels are navigated safely to shore and containers are discharged safely and e ciently. fixed berthing windows are key to bring down waiting time and help terminal operators prepare for the large incoming volumes of the wafmax vessels. in some ports such as walvis bay in conducted to accommodate a fully loaded wafmax vessel. in the port of tema an important milestone was reached in october 2011 when the termi nal delivered an all time high productivi of 64 container moves per hour on a wafmax vessel. fouanipartnerships for better trade as we grow our business in emerg ing markets we have the opportuni and responsibili to create value on social environmental and economic parameters. we have embarked on this journey by exploring opportunities for partnerships with customers and relevant stakehold ers where we can leverage the positive impacts of our business to promote sus tainable development of key industries. one industry where we believe we can make a di erence is agriculture. better trade through sustainable agriculture agriculture is one of the key industry sectors driving emerging market growth. commodities related to agriculture and forestry refrigerated cargo and food and beverages make up approximately 40 of maersk line s global cargo. agriculture s importance will grow in the coming years. on current projections by 2050 global food production will need to increase by 70 to feed the planet s 10 billion people. accounting for 70 of water use and up to 30 of the global greenhouse gas emissions the sector signi cantly contributes to and is threat ened by environmental degradation. at the same time no other sector is more instrumental in ful lling the essential needs of the global population facilitat ing economic development and fuel ling

perspectives on the indian banana trade through our rst socio economic impact study. e study was conducted together with the danish research institute applied economics and health research and firstline communication. it looked at the emerging indian banana trade in detail and discussed the opportunities and challenges associated with growing the trade across all aspects of the indian banana value chain. the banana food for thought bananas are the world s most popular fruit. ey are a staple commodi for many developing countries and very important to food securi. ey also make up around 9 of maersk line s refrigerated cargo business a trade we expect to grow over the coming years. despite being the world s biggest pro ducer less than 1 of indian bananas are exported. 80 of global banana production currently originate from large scale commercial farms but most indian farmers are smallholders. getting the same quali economies of scale and securi of supply when production is spread across hundreds or thousands of farms is challenging. reducing food waste through an unbroken cold chain a key nding in our indian banana case study was the abili of the emerging banana trade to signi cantly reduce post harvest waste levels through the establishment of an unbroken cold chain from pack house to end consumers. many emerging and developing econo mies lack su cient cold chain infra structure. in india for example around 20 30 of locally grown fruits and vegetables rot in transit. is amount is equivalent to the total annual consump tion of fruits and vegetables in the uk. over the course of the years maersk line has invested heavily in innovations in con tainer technology such as maersk line s starcare and quest ii see page 64. ese innovations mean that fruit crops such as bananas can now travel long distances up to 50 days with minimal waste and loss of freshness giving fruit producers around the world new oppor tunities to advance into new export markets. we believe our assets and expertise can contribute to reducing the current waste level and realising some of the export possibilities. we have shared our study with exporters buyers authori ties and

value chains rainforest alliance supporting legal trade globally illegal trade undermines le gitimate business and distorts soci etal and economic development. as a reputable company we recognise that there is a risk to our brand if our ser vices are misused to facilitate illegal trade. while our customers are responsible for the legali of the cargo our stakehold ers are increasingly demanding a more active role from shipping lines in helping to reduce illegal trade. however ship ping lines only have the right to open and investigate a sealed container if it is esti mated to pose a severe securi or safe risk. to reduce the risk of carrying illegal trade we therefore need to be smarter in spotting any risks in our systems and collaborating with relevant stakehold ers to mitigate those risks. becoming part of the solution some of the most challenging issues concerning international trade go well beyond our immediate area of control. however for each challenge there is also an opportuni to become a part of the solution. for maersk line supporting ini tiatives and developments to strengthen legal trade is vital. is is best done by engaging in cross sector collaboration with key customers authorities and credible third par organisations to advance our shared agendas. illegal waste e uk is a major exporter of waste and maersk line has worked together with uk s environmental agency to reduce the risk of shipping illegal waste out of the country. we take it very seriously when illegal waste is discovered in a maersk line container. at the beginning of 2011 maersk line received informa tion that we had unintentionally trans ported about 70 containers of used res to south korea from the uk. e ship ment was not legal and we cooperated with the authorities to ensure that the containers were returned to the uk. in addition we provided information to enable the authorities to investigate further and nd the responsible shipper. illegal trade of wildlife species illegal trade of wildlife species under mine countries e orts to protect their natural resources. some whale and shark species are covered by cites the international convention on trade in endangered species and it is maersk line s policy to not accept any cargos declared as involving whale or shark. newspaper politiken informed that a maersk line shipment did contain shark meat. following this incident we are improving communication of this policy in areas where the risk of shipping shark is high. is work will continue in 2012. spotting the issues at the booking stage in 2011 maersk line initiated a more systematic approach towards cargo misdeclarations and risks for potential illegal commodities. reporting on inci dents and risks in countries and captur ing the learnings in one central platform enables us to discover patterns for example with regard to the speci c trades and bookings. is pe of infor mation and intelligence is an important next step in helping prevent illegal cargo getting on board maersk line ships. we believe that reporting these incidents will ensure global focus on relevant issues. e roll out of this reporting platform will continue in 2012. know your shipper e know your shipper program was piloted in 2011 to enable proactive analy sis of commodities and shippers. is involved dedicating internal resources to identifying high risk shippers and spot ting misdeclarations. e program has so far only been piloted in a handful of countries but has already provided useful knowledge on many trade lanes. e mismatch analysis initiative was also launched with the purpose of discovering shipments where reported name and actual commodi show a mismatch e. g. where the shipper name refers to biscuits and confectionary but the commodi booked is cotton or textiles. is analysis allows us to make the right judgements when suspicious cases arise. better trade the issue of illegal waste illegal waste is a major concern and poses a large risk to the public health and the environment in destination countries. it is estimated that on average approxi mately one out of ten containers expor ted from european international seaports is related to waste. 10 of the waste cargo containers is exported violating applicable environmental rules. on the same time a lot of the cargo maersk line carries on return routes back to asia backhaul cargo contains waste materials i. e. paper and metal that re enter new production cycles. such global recycling patterns would not be possible without cost e cient sea freight and without it our ships would not be fully utilised. many advanced recycling businesses prosper from this opportuni. maersk line has joined forces with other shipping lines operating in the uk to reduce the risk of shipping illegal waste. our cooperation with the industry has been bene cial from both ends. we want to avoid doing unnecessary spot checks as we know the business is operating on a tight schedule. this cooperation has enabled us to work more e ciently with controls earlier in the process. the environment agency for england and wales sustainability progress report 2011 maersk line route 238fighting corruption corruption has emerged as one of the world s greatest challenges. corruption has a negative impact on countries communities and busi nesses impeding economic growth and sustainable development. in some countries corruption is perva sive and has in ltrated most aspects of socie. laws are not enforced uniformly and without discrimination and compa nies are likely to encounter demands for bribes or extortion attempts in meet ings with public o cials. facilitation payments in shipping e shipping sector operates with the whole world as a workplace and depends on frequent interaction with public o cials. a big challenge in the shipping industry is the frequent and persistent demands for low value amounts demanded by public o cials to facilitate port operations so called facilitation payments . typically the demands are for cash cigarettes or soft drinks. it is our policy to oppose facilitation payments and work actively to reduce and eventually eliminate them. we took sever al steps in 2011 to progress on this journey. employees take on the ght in 2011 more than 19 000 maersk line employees completed maersk line s anti corruption course. the course helped equip employees worldwide in applying anti corruption measures in their local environment. it also gave employees a better understanding of the challenges seafarers and employees in the most exposed regions face every day. employ ees have also been provided with check lists and guidance on how to handle a challenging situation. fighting corruption is challenging the norm in some countries. it takes exten sive experience by employees to oppose or minimise demands for facilitation payments while ensuring our operation is not being impacted. opposing demands in the interaction with public servants can reduce demands in one country and lead to severe conse quences in another. e ship can be detained or in worst cases the crew can be exposed to severe extortion situa tions. to that end our policy on anti corruption recognises personal safe as the main priori. open culture and structured reporting having a good understanding of local challenges is an important prerequisite for taking on the challenge. so is having a company culture where issues are being discussed openly to nd the best course of action. ere is a lot to be gained from best practice sharing as our seafarers and o ce personnel regardless of loca tion face similar challenges. maersk line ships and o ces are there fore requested to submit incident reports when they face challenging situations. e reports also identify best practices and suggestions for improvements that can be implemented globally. e reports help us leverage countries knowledge on appropriate anti corruption meas ures and form the basis for prioritising e orts and resources geographically. local maersk line organisations are also asked to map risk areas proactively. by increasing transparency we can verify payments on a detailed

source raw materials to making it easier for consumers to recycle materials at the end of a product s life. part of the big picture is big picture perspective is key to cre ating a sustainable future. but there are still areas of the supply chain that are di cult for our customers to measure or control. up until now transportation and shipping of goods has been one of those areas. at maersk line we are dedicated to helping our customers develop a sus tainable business model by making the supply chain more e cient more visi ble and easier to manage. we are doing that in several ways by increasing sup ply chain e ciency and reducing waste through reliabili creating more choice for customers through better stand ards of transparency in our industry and innovating new solutions to im prove the

averages are only calculated once a year in may leaving us to compare our 2011 performance with an estimated 2010 industry average. making the industry s environmen tal performance 100 transparent lays the groundwork for bench marking. benchmarking is important to create choice for our customers choice on which services customers want to buy and choice regarding which suppliers they want to engage with. we experience that customers certainly want to have a choice about their own supply chain impact. lowering their impact is important to their business growth risk mitigation and sustainabili take decisions in the dark on such impor tant items. we believe strongly in 100 transparency in shipping to o er more choice and di erentiated services. more energy e cient services compared to the averages some shipping lines do not disclose their environmental performance and those that do disclose it anonymously. we are therefore left to benchmark our per formance against estimated industry averages only. maersk line s target is to o er our customers services that are at least 10 lower on co compared to the industry average a position which maersk line gained in 2010. we estimate that our co gap to the industry average was approximately 8 in 2011. is estimate is based on mid 2010 industry emissions data collected by clean cargo working group ccwg. e industry s co emissions data are released every year in may 16. checking the carbon blind spots ocean shipping s impact on the product lifecycle varies substantially from product to product. as ocean freight remains one of the most energy efficient ways of transporting large amounts of cargo the share of the impact is often relatively shipping can make a big difference to a product s overall environmental footprint. however shipping remains in many cases a blind spot in the total lifecycle impact of products. e exercise of collecting data from all supply chain entities is complex and time consuming. and as emissions from ocean shipping fall under the category of scope 3 emis sions manufacturers have some times failed to take them into account. e shipping industry faces an impor tant communication task in making its scope 3 emissions more visible. we are making progress with some of our customers especially where there is a good case for lowering shipping s share of the product lifecycle impact. shipping remains in many cases a blind spot in the total lifecycle impact of products. service excellence service excellence we compete on hard parameters such as reliability and cost. to include the environment on the same high competition parameters we need the industry to play by the same rules so that our customers do not have to make decisions in the dark. lucas vos chief commercial o cer maersk line orange juice highlights the case for raising consumer awareness. at tesco for example oranges for its wide range of orange juice products are sourced from right across the world including places such as brazil south africa and egypt. ey are transported over seas to processing facilities in the uk. tesco reminds consumers that when you buy a carton of freshly squeezed orange juice the impact on the envi ronment can be twice as big as when you buy one which is made out of concentrate. freshly squeezed products incur the greatest transport impacts due to the greater mass of material required to be transported per liter of orange juice product. orange juice from concentrate requires signi cantly smaller quanti ties of material to be transported to the uk to make up the nal product. tesco has carbon footprinted over 1 000 of its own brand products. e carbon footprinting of products helps to identify the sources of co emissions in the life cycle of the prod ucts tesco sells from the growing of the ingredients the manufacturing of the product the packaging the processing the transportation stor age in the shop to the trip to the super market and the way the product is used. by identifying the key points in the lifecycle where carbon emissions are greatest tesco is better able to make carbon reductions. it s important to inform consumers about the choices they have. and it s important to work together with our suppliers to reduce the impact of products. our goal is to reduce our supply chain emissions by 30 by 2020. helen fleming head of

environmen tal footprints to compare their perfor mance. is is a major issue not just for maersk line and its customers but for the entire industry which risks falling behind if it fails to rise to the challenge of making its environmental performance transparent. e challenges are the data they receive is correct. in spite of more shipping lines getting emissions veri ed by an independent third

complete. yet fully integrated into all strategic levels of decision making such as the industry s booking and quotation systems. our vision for choice and transparency we are pushing for a scenario where everyone in our industry fully discloses their carbon performance ship by ship trade lane by trade lane. in this ideal future everyone would measure their performance in the same way and the data they produce would be indepen dently veri ed. if we can achieve this environmental performance would become hard wired into industry decision making processes. a simple a g rating of energy e

commit ted to in 2010 as part of the danone carbon pact programme. committing to common sustainabili goals is a great way of optimising supply chains. while commitments to individu al goals are not very widespread yet we believe that collaboration on concrete targets helps build the foundation for low impact and closed loop businesses. we would like to see this pe of col laboration expand across industries and supply chain parties. from air and road to water and rail reducing the carbon intensi generat ed by transport by strengthening the share of more virtuous transport is strategic to many of our customers for example by replacing trucks with rail transport wherever possible and air with ocean freight. in 2011 we assisted several customers in adjusting their transportation net works to more e cient modes helping them reduce cost and the environmental impact of freight. outokumpu is a global leader in stain less steel manufacturing and employs 8 000 people in more than 30 countries. outokumpu believes that stainless steel will play an important role in the sustainable development of global infrastructure. as part of long term targets for reduc ing co emissions targets for trans

environmental terms. it s not as easy as it sounds it s work in progress but a change in shipping we re committed to lead. goalsprogress in 2011 low impact shipping low impact shipping minimum 10 fuel

world s oceans. sustainability progress report 2011 maersk line route 267sustainability progress report 2011 does distance matter globalisation and the reduction in transport costs have contributed to an exponential growth of distances covered in supply chains. our busi ness plays a role in that. ocean shipping is the most cost e cient means of mass moving goods across large distances and the most energy e cient mode of transportation if you look at the impact of transportation km per product tonnes. but shipping is nevertheless accountable for 3 4 of the world s co emissions 19. distance does matter. given today s environmental challen ges it is understandable that people debate whether or not there is a need for food and other products to travel great dis tances across the globe as part of very large and complex supply and demand networks. to this end producers worldwide are weighing their decisions by taking vari ous aspects into consideration. trans porting and storing less and distributing locally for example make sense in cer tain situations. while the impact stemming from trans portation can be reduced by minimising the distances covered in supply chains we believe that the needed impact reduction across industries will not only come from shorter supply chains. focus on hotspots to radically reduce the environmental impact of today s production consump tion and supply chains we need to address the material impact within each value chain. in some cases transporta tion is a hotspot with a relatively high impact on products lifecycles. in those cases the environmental impact can often be reduced signi cantly by chang ing transportation mode and increasing logistic e ciency. in many cases transportation has a small impact on products life cycles even in spite of great distances between production and consumption. at being said distance does matter but cutting it is not the only answer taking out the negative impact of distance is. at is the outset of maersk line s environmental strategy which focuses on addressing the environmen tal hotspots in shipping and facilitating smarter transportation of goods. in turn smart transportation helps ena ble smart and e cient production of food and goods. raw materials should be grown where resources provide the greatest production e ciency. and food and goods need to be traded to move from surplus to de cit areas. our route to low impact shipping is a commitment to advancing e ciencies in and beyond our own industry. low impact shipping sustainability progress report 2011 maersk line route 269

about meeting but exceeding and setting new industry standards volker daut head of dest. transport logistics adidas group sustainability progress report 2011 maersk line route 271addressing carbon emissionsmaersk line accounts for 0. 1 of the world s co emissions. in 2011 our eet of container ships emitted 33. 8 million tonnes of co to the air. maersk line operates the biggest eet of container ships in the world more than 600 ships and about 3. 4 million teu con tainers. today the environmental impact of running a eet this size is signi cant in absolute terms. it is a challenge we do not take lightly. in 2011 our absolute air emis sions increased with the expansion of our eet. while our size comes with a sub stantial footprint it is also our scale and size that will help enable our journey to wards low carbon shipping. we are building on solid performance. since 2007 we have reduced our co footprint per container by 15. 6. improving energy e ciency includes a wide range of measures ranging from making the most of our daily operation and planning using new pes of tech nologies to innovating our ships and container technology and designs. reducing fuel consumption is key our environmental performance is closely tied to our consumption of fuel. co is produced as ships use petroleum based fossil fuels primarily bunker fuel to power the engines. in comparison with other petroleum products bunker fuel is extremely crude. slowing down 600 ships today the single biggest impact on fuel consumption is speed. slowing down helps us increase energy efficiency. it also means we can better ensure arrival at an agreed time because the lower average speeds give us the exibili to speed up if something unforeseen happens. e way we manage our 600 container ships and navigate them through the oceans is thus of crucial importance to our environmental performance. a tiny speed increase as little as 0. 5 knot could increase fuel consumption by 6 corresponding to a cost increase of usd 340 million 20. in 2011 maersk line improved its fuel consumption management system for the global eet. e system tracks fuel use by each ship on every voyage and compares real performance with an op timum modelled performance. e dif ferences between the two the potential cost and co savings and recommenda tions on improvements are distributed to all internal stakeholders on a monthly basis. today anyone with a signi cant in u ence on fuel consumption in maersk line has fuel consumption in their perfor mance scorecard and the incentives for fuel e ciency are very clear. perfor mances are compared and a monthly report rates each service s energy e ciency based on an a g rating system. in 2011 maersk line reduced its fuel consumption per container teu by 2. 7 this way corresponding to a total cost reduction of usd 135 million. 20 calculations based on a fuel price of 600 metric ton. as a company dedicated to building sustainability into everything we do we re focused on reducing our environmental impact at every level of our supply chain including transportation and distribution. through the changes we ve made in partnership with companies like maersk line we have reduced total miles traveled saved fuel reduced greenhouse emissions and saved money. this reduces cost and our customers receive our product in a more timely manner. re examining its transportation network by re examining its transportation network through the lens of sustaina bili levi strauss co. reduced green house gas emissions by 50 60 in 2008. in 2009 the company was able to reduce carbon emissions by more than 700 metric tonnes and save money while continuing to meet service levels. e contributions came from shifting from the most carbon intensive modes of transport air and trucking to less intensive modes such as rail and container ships adopting e cient processes and partnering with trans portation service providers. levi strauss co. also made changes to its international shipping routes to reduce the carbon footprint from transportation. as an example the company shifted product routing using all water services to the u. s. east coast. is reduced

planning in 2011 our captains made more than 35 000 voyages. experienced captains can save signi cant quantities of fuel through careful planning of a ship s voyage from start to nish. we have codi ed the many tricks of their trade in our innovative fuel and cost saving tool eco voyage developed with inputs from many of our captains. the software recommends the most fuel efficient voyage based on factors such as voyage time weather and sea conditions ocean current the draught of the ship and the fuel e ciency of the ship at dif ferent speeds. in 2011 our eco voyage tool helped us reduce fuel consumption by 1. using waste heat to power our ships maersk line is the rst in the industry to install waste heat recovery systems as a standard on all new ships. a waste heat recovery system captures the engine s hot exhaust gas to produce extra energy for propulsion and reduces fuel con sumption and co emissions by approxi mately 9. 39 maersk line ships including 3 chartered ships now have a waste heat recovery system. 42 maersk line ships on order including the 20 new triple e class ships will all have waste heat recovery systems. fuelling large ships on micro algae we believe diversifying our fuel supply will help us reduce our impacts further. using biofuels for shipping is still a relatively new technology but in sep tember 2011 our container ship maersk kalmar steamed o with two tank con tainers on the deck full of 30 tonnes of algae based soladiesel. e biofuel was used in di erent blends throughout the voyage from germany to india. e trial conducted in partnership with maersk line limited mll and the us in fact fuel large container ships. e cost of high quali algae based biofuel is currently too great for regular com mercial use but we believe that with fur ther development biofuels such as those derived from algae may be possible to use regularly for container shipping. triple e class e ciency becomes reality in 2011 we made a quantum leap in inno vating the ship and engine designs of the near future ordering 20 triple e class ships. e rst of these 18 000 teu ships will be deployed in 2013 bringing with it new economies of scale energy e cien cy and unprecedented environmental performance. optimised for slow steaming mean that co emissions per container moved by triple e will be approximately half those of the current industry average on the asia europe trade. triple e will give maersk line s customers access to one of the most energy and cost e cient modes of transportation in the world. can ships run on algae straw and wood in recent years biofuels for transporta tion has grown from science ction to something much more real. for example eu regulation now requires biodiesel to be blended with diesel for road transpor tation. while it is technically possible for con tainer ships to run on biofuels price availabili and sustainabili are currently barriers to wide scale production and uptake of these fuels. we need lower grade sustainable biofu els that can be scaled up at the right price. we are therefore very excited that the danish advanced technology foun dation is funding a research platform on developing biofuels for shipping which includes leading global actors in biofuel development such as the universi energy. as part of this platform we will seek to develop biofuels tailored to the speci c needs of shipping and ship engines. we hope this will prove to be an important rst step in making biofuels for shipping a commercial reali low impact shipping in shipping our main expectation is that our

several ways a shipping line can reduce so x emissions through fuel switching to low sulphur fuel cleaning the exhaust gas and using alternative fuels. we are committed to reduce our sox impact beyond regulatory require ments and our long term aspiration is to drive global so x emissions towards zero. e primary focus within our zero so x programme is to reduce so x emissions in the proximi of port

consequently reduce so x emissions signi cantly. since 2006 maersk line has conducted 6 voluntary fuel switch programmes worldwide. we call them voluntary because they go beyond regulatory requirements. we have committed to at least 10 fuel switch programmes before 2015. fuel switches are prioritised for locations where so x concentrations are high and where we can partner with ports and other stakeholders to share the cost of switching to cleaner and more expensive fuels. while our fuel switch programmes have an immediate positive e ect for the inhabitants of those ports they are hardly su cient in the bigger scheme of things. to address what we believe to be one of the biggest issues in shipping all shipping lines need to cut their so x emissions. after all it is so x

and atmospheric research protecting biodiversi when invasive species hitch a ride from one part of the world to another on big ships it is a major threat to local ocean ora and fauna. ships carry ballast water to provide sta bili aid steering and control trim and draft. but ballast water often originates from ports and other coastal regions rich in plankton and other marine organisms. discharging ballast water originating from one marine environment into another can introduce alien species into a marine ecosystem threatening its ecological balance. to reduce the impact on biodiversi maersk line discharges ballast water midway on the journey. but as we ex change up to 10 million cubic metres of water every year this measure is not suf cient also not in light of anticipated regulatory developments. so in 2011 we committed to installing a ballast water treatment system on all new ships built in 2012 and onwards. is system cleans the water thoroughly before releasing it back into the sea. we expect that the imo ballast water convention will enter into force in 2012 making ballast water treatment the norm going forward. using our assets to measure ocean health as our ships are present in every ocean they are attractive platforms for researchers who want to measure the ocean health using samples from all over the globe. in 2011 maersk became members

indonesia and customers worldwide. jakob friis sorensen president director of maersk line indonesia sustainability progress report 2011 maersk line route 295maersk line does not discharge any waste in the ocean except for organic waste. is means that adequate re ception facilities must be available in the ports to ensure safe and responsible handling of waste. in 2010 we developed a standard oper ating procedure describing how the ven dors in ports should handle the sludge and garbage disposed of by our ships. we rate the vendors based on this proce dure. in 2011 37 of 159 vendors were rated red by our organisation as they did not live up to the standards described in our operating procedures. e exercise on following up on red agged vendors is in its early stage. in 2011 we made some progress by conducting four workshops with port authorities in rotterdam antwerp singapore and hong kong to understand the barriers and possibilities for safe waste disposal. rotterdam and antwerp lead the way rotterdam and antwerp are rated green in our rating system because they handle sludge and waste in an environ mentally safe way. our ratings testify to the two ports consistent leadership on safe waste handling activities. ey continue to raise the bar and now work to improve the performance of port reception facilities even further. we recommend our ships not to dispose of sludge and waste in red rated ports. to improve the standards in these ports we are sharing best practices from rotterdam and antwerp. getting more ports on board in 2011 we de ned a pilot project to map the performance of 12 deep sea ports in north europe. rotterdam and antwerp will be used as role models to ensure that sludge and waste is handled safely in all of the north european ports. the pilot project will also be used to guide ports in the rest of the world on how to improve port reception facilities ensuring sludge and waste is handled in the best possible way. engaging with ports on waste handling supply chain innovation ship owners join fuel optimisation drive about two thirds of the container eet sailing under the maersk ag is owned by other companies and chartered by maersk line. so the performance of these container ships is important to meeting our target of reducing co by 25 per container from 2007 to 2020. on average maersk line owned vessels are estimated to be around 5 10 more fuel e cient than the chartered eet. our goal requires collaboration and coor dination as the chartered fleet is covering a diverse group of around 80 different com panies including major and minor players. our long term goal is to boost the char tered fleet s energy efficiency to the level of maersk line owned ships. our experi ence shows that major e ciency gains can be made from factors such as the tuning of engines choice of hull paint and timing and quali of hull and propel ler cleaning. extending our performance management approach in 2011 we took an important step by ex tending maersk line s performance man agement approach to the chartered fleet. e ship owners welcomed our initiative and request to supply performance and other data about their vessels. e data was used to develop theoretical models of performance for every pe of ship and baselines against which real perfor mance can be compared. in 2011 maersk line s reporting system was installed on the rst 140 charter ships. the first batch of energy efficiency scorecards was published in the begin ning of 2012. maersk line s reporting system and scorecard setup enables benchmarking between vessels meaning owners can compare how sister ships within their eet are performing. ough maersk line carries the cost of the bunker fuel owners will be incentivised to perform well so that they have good results to report when charters are renewed. in 2011 the co footprint of the chartered eet was reduced by 5. 8 per container teu km. supply chain innovation we are pleased to join maersk line s fuel e

identi ed the mooring opera tion as one of the highest injury and risk areas. mooring is the operation of secur ing a container ship to a xed quay or berth by means of mooring lines or ca bles. to improve our safe performance in 2011 we launched a safer mooring campaign on our ships. in 2011 injuries occurring during moor ing operations decreased by 30. we are not satis ed with the fact that injuries still occur during this critical task and will continue our focus on safe mooring operations in 2012. taking near miss reporting to the next level in 2011 we launched a campaign to improve the reporting of near misses on ships. a near miss is an unplanned event that did not result in injury illness or damage but had the potential to do so. only a fortunate break in the chain of events prevented the injury. recognising and reporting near miss incidents can make a major di erence to the safe of our employees. history has shown repeatedly that most accidents were preceded by warnings near acci dents or narrow escapes. helped us get reporting of near misses on the radar. subsequently near miss reports increased from 5 518 reports in 2010 to 13 148 reports in 2011 an increase of 240. following up on near misses when a near miss report is submitted by a ship it is reviewed by the marine stand ards department who provides assis tance to the crews in preventing the near miss from happening again. captains can view their near miss statistics and compare it to their peers. e statistics help the crews spot trends and risk areas. e commitment of the crews to report on near misses is essential to our safe culture. it helps us create an open culture in which we share risk assessments best practices and action plans in a responsible manner. when an injuryhappens on board safe meetings are held every month on all maersk line ships to discuss safe performance and decide on proactive measures. when an injury does happen it is crucial that it is being thoroughly investigated and measurements are taken to prevent it from happening again. when an injury report is submit ted by a ship the injury is discussed in detail with marine standards and subse quently an action plan is made. in 2011 maersk line added extra human re sources to ensure su cient following up on injury reports. port authorities inspect maersk line ships during the last two years we have seen an increase in port state controls psc. e trend is more frequent and detailed inspections. e inspection is performed by psc o cers who go on board to verify that the condition of the ship and its equipment comply with international conventions and that the vessel is manned and operated in compliance with applicable international law. in 2010 psc o cers inspected 194 ships through 265 inspections. in 2011 the number increased to 202 vessels and 494 inspections. in 65 of the inspec tions no de ciencies were recorded. as a consequence of more rigid psc in spections we launched several initiatives to guarantee improvement. we have de veloped guidelines on preventing deficien cies and findings in psc audits are shared across the eet. we initiated a bench mark study together with boston con sulting group who looked at our psc per formance. e report shows that we are on par with the container industry aver age for psc deficiencies which is approxi mately one de ciency per inspection. in spite of having increased our focus on psc inspections we unfortunately had ve ship detentions this year. avoiding fatigue through rest hour reporting crew members on maersk line ships must get the rest time required by law. compliance with rest hour rules remains a priori. we are following the principles issued by the ilo 180 convention to monitor the hours of work and rest. in 2011 we took several initiatives to ensure the limits are not being violated. a rest hour awareness campaign was launched to improve the rest hour plan ning on vessels. captains and crews have been

exploding reefer containers in 2011 maersk line grounded 844 refrigerated containers following three tragic fatalities and a number of accidents onshore. e refriger ated containers exploded on three separate occasions in itajai brazil and cat lai vietnam. after a thorough investigation we found out that the explosions were caused by contaminated refrigerants allowing an otherwise inert system to react violently. together with the main producer of the refrigerants we located the main source to be a coun terfeit product. we reached out to other shipping lines through the industry association the world shipping council wsc and sub sequently also the container owners association coa and later on to reefer machinery manufacturers leading forensic and test institutes amongst others with the objective of sharing knowledge and best practices in com bating this threat. steps to prevent the issue from recur ring have been taken with further initia tives in the pipeline for example the development of new testing methods and procedures. we hope that the indus try continues to collaborate on preven tative measures to restore safe and con dence in the reefer container trans portation industry. the issue ofoverweight containers overweight containers pose safe risks to people and assets throughout the entire transportation chain. ey remain a serious issue in almost all regions and trades. in the shipping industry wrongly declared containers cause issues in vessel plan ning and stowage. if there are too many overweight containers stowed on deck a ship may lose stabili and even

risksdealing withthe threats of piracy piracy continues to pose a consider able impact on our seafarers and business in general. e constant threat impacts the safe and well being of our employees our service and cost. countering piracy remains a high priori. according to the international chamber of commerce there have been 421 pirate attacks and 42 hijackings world wide in 2011. ough many of these incidents originate from armed robbery stealing cargo or personal belongings from crews the majori is aimed at hijacking crew ships and cargo for ransom. most of these attacks occur in the waters surrounding the failed state of somalia. by the end of 2011 10 ships and some 170 seafarers were held hostage by somali pirates. the impact of piracy is devastating in many ways piracy from somalia has a negative impact on stabili in east africa as a whole and causes a number of problems locally regionally and globally. first and foremost piracy is a threat to the merchant seafarers who risk being attacked wounded taken hostage or killed whilst transiting the waters to maintain global trade. piracy has a con siderable economic impact to global re gional and local economies which su er from increased cost on import and ex port. piracy is also a threat to the environ ment as it forces speed increases and thereby creates higher air emissions. according to private risk assessment provider marisk piracy around somalia resulted in 213 attacks and 30 hijackings in 2011. ough the number of success ful hijackings have been halved compared to 2010 the number of attacks have not decreased. e main reasons for this are believed to be the increased e orts initi ated by the shipping industry and the continued international political will to ght piracy. e better cooperation and information sharing among the naval entities and the industry also contrib utes to the reduction of piracy attacks. however the present international activi ties have not deterred the pirates from attacking merchant vessels and incen tives for piracy remain high in somalia. anti piracy coordinator as a result of the development in piracy activities in 2010 maersk line decided to top already in place initiatives by employing a dedicated person to head our anti piracy coordination and to be maersk line s point of contact regarding piracy related issues. e position as anti piracy coordinator which is believed to be the rst of its kind within the shipping industry is also responsible for maersk line s strategic approach to ght piracy and for coordi nation with international partners. ship protection measures prior to applying defensive measures on ships a thorough voyage risk assessment is conducted in order to de ne the speci c protective measures to be applied on the individual vessel e. g. razor wire extra lookout safe gear and safe drills. e shipping industry is increasingly nding it necessary to use armed guards on vessels to ensure the safe of the crew. however arming merchant vessels deals only with the symptoms of piracy and is not a long term solution to the root causes. 85 say maersk line is committed to securi e. g. against piracy theft and armed robbery voice of seafarers workplace sustainability sustainability progress report 2011 maersk line route 2117maersk line is in favour of the introduc tion of mandatory weighing of contain ers prior to loading. at would ensure correct weight declarations and help shipping lines reduce accidents and loss of containers. we support and encourage the international maritime organisation imo to establish such legal requirements. containers overboard ere is a public perception including within the international maritime organisation imo and the eu com mission that around 10 000 containers are lost overboard container ships every year. if true the safe and environmental risk would be substantial. e container carrier industry association therefore assembled data for the past three years. ey arrived at an average annual loss of approximately 675 containers including those resulting from single catastrophic elements de ned as 50 and more containers lost in a single event. over the past ve years maersk line in comparison lost on average 42 con tainers annually. while severe weather conditions can have an impact some can also be attributed to human error. overall we have been able to maintain a relatively low gure because of careful and systematic checks and procedures from the time of accepting the booking until the container is physically loaded on board. our personnel and service provid ers at land and sea will continue to spot and isolate containers that may have potential safe risks. we are making progress in forming an industry wide initiative that will help shipping lines know the exact gross weight of containers before loaded on board our ships. knowing the exact weight on board will help us further reduce the number of containers lost overboard. our overall objective remains zero containers overboard. safe transportation in 2011 maersk line launched a saftey training programme for employees to highlight how actions or non actions on land a ect the safe of those at

group commis sioned independent survey organi sation globescan to carry out a brand reputation survey of all maersk busi nesses including maersk line. globescan asked a group of 400 stake holders drawn from customers employ media their impressions of maersk line and its competitors. it s been good to learn that maersk line is generally well perceived and 80 of our stakeholders would be happy to recommend us. globescan also asked respondents what issues they felt were most impor tant to maersk s brand and reputation and how maersk line is performing. we were encouraged to nd we are doing well on many of their priori issues not least our innovation capabili quali service nancial strength and high safe standards factors which have long been key priorities within maersk. eir belief in our abili to open new markets gives us con dence in our plans to ad vance emerging markets trade. but our stakeholders were less con vinced in other areas for example our commitment to integrate sustainabili into investment decisions and the level of transparency we o er. on di erent human resource issues we still have some way to go with some employees being concerned about the reward structure and whether their voic es are being su ciently heard. is is important feedback. as our sus tainabili strategy enters its third year we are aware that we need to continue to improve our employee and customer value proposition and engage more openly with stakeholders so that we understand their concerns and they can see the changes we are making. as a result we are building our e orts in these areas and focusing harder on com munication stakeholder engagement and relationship building. globescan s conclusion was that our solid business fundamentals support a strong reputation and that our sus tainabili strategy could strengthen it further. delivering on sustainable shipping initiative s joint vision for our industry will help drive needed change in operating models thereby allowing economies to grow trade to develop and social wealth to spread. maersk line has a license to act boldly on the global stage. with that comes high expectations that extend beyond the balance

15015,18873,COP_-_Global_Compact_-_VF.pdf,groupe seb 28 06 16 2 communication on progress july 2016 human rights global compact principles principle 1 businesses should support and respect the protec tion of internationally proclaimed human rights and principle 2 ensure no company entity is complicit in any kin d of human rights abuses. commitments excerpts from groupe seb code of ethic s responsibility extended to our suppliers we require all of our suppliers to respect our eth ical commitments. these commitments are set out in detail in the groupe seb responsible pur chasing charter which is applicable to all suppliers without exception. we check that our suppliers respect our ethical re quirements. if we detect any kind of non conformity we react immediately in order to remedy the situation. health and safety we have set up a health and safety policy aiming t o guarantee a healthy and safe working environment for each employee. this policy is appli cable in all countries in which we operate. each and every one of us must enforce this health a nd safety dimension in the way we work by respecting instructions and raising the alarm fo r any potential risk. developments 2015 2016 human rights respect for human rights forms an integral part of the groupe seb code of ethics as well as the training offered in this regard to internati onal hr managers. as a signatory of the global compact since 2003 the group decided to eva luate its teams practices in relation to human rights in subsidiaries employing more than 10 people starting in 2007. to achieve this up until 2014 it used the hrca human rights compliance assessment quick check self assessment tool developed by the danish insti tute for human rights and for sites operated by its chinese subsidiary supor the cbssc china business and social sustainability check a version of the hrca specia lly adapted for china. these self assessments which were carried out every couple of years or so covered almost 99 of the workforce and resulted in corrective action plans w here necessary. in seven years they enabled all sites to gain a high level of awareness of this issue. in 2015 groupe seb decided to take things to anoth er level by applying the same ethical social and environmental audit procedure that it op erates with its suppliers to its industrial sites in hazard areas using the same specialist co nsulting firm intertek. audits will be accompanied by action plans to correct any non comp liances. these plans will be monitored by the sustainable development department and forwa rded to the audit and organisation department which can verify their application duri ng internal audits. for the industrial sites in question which will be audited every two years th is system similar to the one used for the group s suppliers will allow to make external comp arisons and to generate audits on which the group s customers can rely. in 2016 these type s of audits will be conducted on the group s industrial sites in colombia china sseac and vietnam. supor the group s chinese subsidiary is not subject to this process since it has already embarked upon the groupe seb 28 06 16 3 sa 8000 basic human rights of workers certificati on process which by its very nature includes these types of audit. supor s first site t o be sa 8000 certified was shaoxing in 2015. registration document and annual financial report 2 015 p. 88 responsible purchasing with more than 14 000 suppliers worldwide groupe s eb bears great responsibility in terms of the manufacturing of its products under ethical conditions. for this reason the group has committed to a responsible purchasing policy and ha s implemented reporting and control systems to ensure that its suppliers comply with it s ethical labour and environmental requirements. since 2012 this policy has been bols tered with numerous projects responsible purchasing charter in conjunction with the group s code of ethics. s ent to listed suppliers it explains what the group requir es from its suppliers in relation to human rights and its ethical social and environmental pr inciples. this charter was sent to all of the group s listed suppliers including supor. around 90 of suppliers who received the responsible purchasing charter have signed up to it s requirements or have been deemed to be compliant thanks to their own existing policies social and environmental criteria in the preliminary evaluation of new suppliers. cs r criteria account for 25 of the score given to new suppliers of raw materials components and finished products. moreover since 2013 if just on e of the social or environmental criteria is rated unsatisfactory the supplier will be struck o ff. for the environmental portion these criteria primarily include the following aspects i so 14001 certification visible pollution water ground and air and use of hazardous produ cts. for the social portion the main criteria involve existence of a formal ethical soc ial policy or the signature of groupe seb s responsible purchasing charter working conditions observance of employment law age working hours etc. and of safety rules. to evalua te new indirect non production suppliers the csr criteria account for 15 of the score ethical social and environmental audits. since 2015 these audits have been conducted by the consulting firm intertek which replaced sg s. in addition to more detailed audit criteria approximately twice as many checkpoints intertek offers a highly effective global audit management tool with immediate and specific l isted supplier monitoring. this tool also makes it possible to compare the results obtained b y the group s suppliers with those of companies listed in the intertek database which in cludes over 30 000 audits. the procedure is very formal. during an initial in depth audit i nvolving one to three days on site depending on the size of the company the auditors review ne arly 300 checkpoints taken from the wca workplace condition assessment audit criteria. ea ch checkpoint is assessed according to a four level scale of compliance ranging from zero tolerance forced labour blocked emergency exits to minor non compliance with mode rate and major non compliance no pay slip faulty electrical installation etc. in b etween. the final score calculated out of 100 is ranked according to four performance levels high p erformance 85 to 100 average 71 to 84 poor 51 to 70 and very poor 0 to 50. the a udit report is sent to the group s purchasing department. one single zero tolerance non compliance e. g. failure to comply with the legal working age triggers the following actions a letter from the group s purchasing director requiring the implementation of a corrective action plan within two weeks immediate suspension of any new consultation and follow up audit by intertek three months later to check that the issue has been resol ved. if not the group ends the collaboration. with scores of less than 50 the reg ional head of purchasing sends a formal letter warning the company to correct the breach an d follows this up with an audit three months later. every year the group audits about a q uarter of its listed suppliers of raw materials components and finished products in terms of their compliance with its ethical social and environmental requirements. in 2015 the group carried out 134 first time audits vs 153 in 2014 and 145 in 2013 all of which were handled by intertek. these involved groupe seb 28 06 16 4 suppliers in asia south america europe and turkey. four suppliers presented zero tolerance non compliances. in all four cases this related to blocked emergency exits. three other suppliers obtained a score of less than 50 p rimarily due to non compliance in relation to wages and working hours. these companies all und ertook corrective action in the manner suggested by the group and no suppliers were remove d from the list. a total of nearly 30 follow up audits were conducted in 2015. intertek a lso hands out an achievement award aa label to suppliers who have an overall score o f at least 85 and do not present any major or zero tolerance type non compliances. in addition the group recognised 5 suppliers as being compliant with the group s audit policy upo n presentation of the results of their bsci business social compliance initiative audit. charter of ethical social and environmental audits. drafted in 2013 it was updated in 2015 to incorporate the new audit procedure foll owing the change of consulting firm. for the sake of transparency this document is sent to suppliers along with the points on which they will be rated during the audit. to help suppli ers make progress on social and environmental matters the group organises training sessions for their benefit on this topic. in 2015 three meetings in shenzhen and shanghai were held with the representatives of 70 chinese suppliers and were attended by group buy ers responsible for monitoring said suppliers internal global network of social audit leaders. ten purchasing directors from asia 4 south america 3 and europe 3 make up the n etwork of social audit leaders. they are responsible for the completion of audits fallin g within their remit and for progress plans undertaken by suppliers. the network is kept active with quarterly meetings chaired by the group purchasing director covering reports on the audits analysis of results exchange of best practices etc. raising the awareness of the purchasing community i n relation to sustainable development. purchasing teams total 300 people worldwide. to ga lvanise this community the purchasing department is using hour long web fo rums organised on a monthly basis on specific topics. the november 2015 web forum was de voted to the introduction of sustainable development into groupe seb purchasing with a focus on ethical social and environmental audits. it was facilitated by the gro up s sustainable development director. registration document and annual financial report 2 015 p. 88 90 groupe seb 28 06 16 5 health and safety for several years groupe seb has taken steps to re duce the number of workplace accidents and limit the number of work related heal th conditions primarily musculoskeletal disorders msds. in order to put health and safety at the forefront of all its employees minds in 2012 a strategic health and safety commit tee was set up involving three members of the executive committee as well as an i nternational operational committee. the strategic committee sets health and safety poli cy and direction for the group and defines priorities. the operational committee ident ifies the necessary actions and standards to implement the strategic committee s decisions. t hese committees meet alternately each quarter. the health and safety policy is steered by the quality department with two persons dedicated to it full time. it is based on a global network of 28 environmental health and safety coordinators ehs who became fully operati onal in 2014. they cover all industrial and logistics sites. tertiary sites for their part have ehs reference contacts. since 2007 the group has been committed to the certification of it s health and safety management system ohsas 18001 with 89. 5 of industrial and logisti cal entities certified at the end of 2015. safety groupe seb gave new impetus to its safety efforts i n 2012 when it launched the global safety in seb programme. this approach is backed by the highest levels of management as shown by the letter sent by thierry de la tour d artaise to all employees on this issue in 2013. the ceo has also made a video presenting t he group s safety policy which has been translated into eight languages and disseminat ed widely among the teams with the support of local management. in 2015 the group con tinued to deploy its safety standards worldwide. these procedures formalise the group s m inimum requirements above and beyond compliance with national and international r egulations. these standards are incorporated into safety management procedures and are written in english french and chinese. they apply to all teams worldwide. some st andards concern safety organisation and management whilst others target the prevention of specific risks falls from a height machine protection etc. . an internal audit was con ducted to ensure their application. at the end of 2015 14 standards were operational and 8 ot hers were due to become operational by the end of 2016. being aware that over 80 of accid ents could be avoided by a change of behaviour the group included a set of tools in the se standards such as behavioural safety inspections bsi. the aim of this tool is to elimi nate dangerous practices and conditions on the basis of dialogue between inspected employees and their line managers. on average every production or logistics site employee is insp ected twice a year. training in how to conduct behavioural safety inspections continued in 2015 usa germany brazil shanghai and a behavioural safety inspection monitoring indi cator was introduced in france in 2015. it will be extended to cover international sites in 20 16. another good practice which has become a group standard is the safety pyramid. thi s aims to detect future events likely to result in accidents so that these can be prevented. and so faced with a potentially hazardous situation or a near miss the individual has to take immediate action to prevent the risk and to report it so that corrective measures c an be taken. since 2013 every accident that has a direct relation to work is reported to a ll site mangers and to ehs coordinators in groupe seb to strengthen preventive measures flash safety vigilance tool. each plant and logistics site also defined five unbreakable r ules to address major risks no deviation from which will be tolerated. health the groupe seb health plan focuses on fighting musc uloskeletal disorders msds to the upper body and back pain. the aim is to prevent the m from appearing and slow their deterioration. this is a major issue for the plants particularly in europe exacerbated by the ageing of the workforce and extensions to the pensi on age. the group s response involves awareness raising and training measures taking msd prevention into account from the design phase forward and carrying out specific meas ures in the sites. every french industrial groupe seb 28 06 16 6 and logistics site has a steering committee for mus culoskeletal disorders and one or more msd specialists who will ensure risks will be taken into account upstream at the product design stage and downstream by amending workstati ons where appropriate. ergonomic improvements to workstations training and staff ro tation warm up and cool down exercises as well as quick response whenever an employee indi cates discomfort while working have helped reduce since 2010 the number of msds repor ted. the approach is gradually being rolled out internationally in ways suited to local contexts. in 2014 the group reviewed the product development process so as to take account o f health issues at each phase and prevent msds for the line workers responsible for t heir manufacture. in early 2015 the groupe seb university and the industry department l aunched a training programme primarily aimed at methods teams several modules o f which are devoted to the prevention of msds school of methods. ohsas 18001 certification since 2007 the group has involved all its sites in the certification of its health and safety management system ohsas 18001. at year end 2015 89. 5 of the group s industrial and logistics entities now hold this workplace health a nd safety certification. action plans aiming to bring this figure to 100 by the end of 2017 hav e been approved. registration document and annual financial report 2 015 p. 98 100 labor standards principles of the global

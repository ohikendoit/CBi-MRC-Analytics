awareness of the negative impacts of waste has increased there are limited regulatory and nancial incentives to drive large scale and systematic changes. waste reduction e orts are largely local and most hotels rely heavily on municipalities and external organizations for waste and recycling programs. waste is heavily driven by human behavior so to make long term and meaningful progress toward our waste goals we have to engage hilton team members franchise employees and guests in our e orts. introduction opportunities communities environment waste the world bank estimates that global urban populations create 1. 6 billion tons of solid waste per year and more than half of that ends up in land lls. in the united states the hospitality industry alone produces 1. 9 billion pounds of waste annually. take smaller meal portions leading to reduced food waste and cost savings. no bin day grew from an idea at one hotel into a weekly program that every hilton team member restaurant in the

business for social responsibility to evaluate current waste and diversion practices and develop metrics to track measure and report data. hilton was the rst major hospitality company to partner with global soap in 2011 which recently joined forces with clean the world. we ve been instrumental in providing operational expertise and expanding global soap s footprint. our approach our waste strategy focuses on measuring and managing our waste output and diversions while also continually looking for creative ways to reduce our waste footprint. we gather and translate waste hauling data into relevant metrics that hilton team members franchise employees owners and management groups can use to make decisions and set goals to improve performance over time. we also work with hotels to educate them on identifying waste from items that have historically been discarded that can actually be repurposed and reused. we developed repurpose our comprehensive waste management program to support hotels e orts to reduce waste through reusing repurposing recycling and donating items instead of sending them to land ll. we also have shifted from hotel goals that target a reduction of total output to a focus on total diversion from land ll to promote recycling and donations at the hotel level. hotels are now required to set their own annual goals to push engagement and better results. action reporting through lightstay we leverage lightstay our measurement platform to understand how our hotels are managing waste and driving improvements over time. since launching lightstay we ve gathered

hauling data in lightstay which allows hotels to monitor current performance against their diversion targets and share best practices through their yearly waste initiatives. in addition repurpose provides resources and partnerships that support hilton s portfolio of hotels in their e orts to reduce food waste and increase recycling of items ranging from soap to bed mattresses. soap recycling is one of the areas where repurpose has broken the most ground. since our rst soap recycling partnership in 2011 we have identi ed new partners to grow the program which includes more than 650 hotels. hilton properties have donated over 600 000 pounds of soap which have been converted into over 1. 6 million new bars to help promote public health in underserved communities by preventing hygiene related deaths and illness. living sustainably campaigns our quarterly living sustainably campaigns empower and inspire hilton team members and franchise employees to make changes to reduce waste. the fourth quarter campaign takes a proactive waste reduction approach. hotels are encouraged to identify a waste item they would like to address in the following year and investigate ways to improve the waste management of this item through low cost and creative changes. many of our hotels develop new waste reduction ideas that can be replicated around the world. for example no bin day encourages hilton team members and franchise employees to remove all waste bins from their dining areas encouraging them to we also partner with soapcycling and activated soap4hope a soap recycling program of sealedair diversey one of our strategic soap suppliers to support more than 65 hotels in asia paci c africa and latin america. across our partnerships hilton continues to be the largest multi brand hospitality company currently participating in soap recycling. in collaboration with serta simmons and global sustainability solutions our hotels are able to recycle their mattresses and box springs rather than sending them to a land ll. the components of the mattresses and box springs are repurposed into various products with approximately 95 percent of the components being recycled. bed frames are also recycled through the mattress recycling program. we also partner with waste management sustainability services wmss which provides recycling consulting and support to owned and managed properties in the americas. together we ve focused on recycling uorescent lamps lighting ballasts batteries and mercury containing devices. another major wmss initiative includes utilizing monitors on

waste which is the fastest growing waste stream in the world. in partnership with global sustainability solutions lg electronics and samsung our hotels in the united states can safely recycle their tvs preventing harmful substances from leaking in land lls. our environmental e orts have been recognized in 2015 as a forbes top 50 green brand and as a newsweek top green company in the world for our environmental performance. in 2012 a kitchen stewarding hilton team member at the doubletree by hilton gurgaon had an idea to reduce food waste by simply removing waste bins from the hilton team member restaurant to encourage people to only take portions they can nish. his no bin day idea was swiftly adopted by fellow properties in india the hilton garden inn new delhi saket and hilton mumbai international airport. when the regional team caught wind of no bin day in 2014 they scaled it across india as a weekly practice with hilton team member support. by 2015 no bin day was formally launched in 135 hotels in asia paci c with hotels recording up to 95 percent reductions in food waste in a single day. now the project is available for any hotel globally all because of a simple cost free idea from one hilton team member. no bin day from a local idea to a global success story hilton team members include employees of hilton worldwide at corporate o ces owned managed leased and timeshare properties. franchise employees include employees at independently owned and operated franchised properties. while franchisees and their employees are not employed by us they are a large part of our brands and our culture of hospitality. in addition to our corporate responsibility initiatives we o er franchisees training and recognition programs and provide them with other resources that are relevant to them and their businesses. in recent years consumers investors and other stakeholders have pressed for increased transparency around how businesses manage their carbon footprint. at the same time some countries have introduced regulations to curb carbon emissions. as the scienti c evidence and political interest grow the need for global action against carbon emissions is becoming stronger. these factors have contributed to an increased focus on measuring and reporting carbon emissions across all industries including hospitality. given our reach as a business we are working strategically and collaboratively to identify solutions for reducing carbon emissions across our operations. continue to reduce our environmental footprint through energy e ciencies and investing in renewable energy to decrease scope 1 2 and 3 carbon emissions. 1. 6 absolute carbon reduction of 1. 6 percent in 2014 vs. 2013. 20. 9 carbon reduction of 20. 9 percent since 2009

to growing a low carbon future by investing in renewable energy sources and partnering with our suppliers to tackle our shared carbon footprint. opportunities communities environment partnerships associations awards certi cations in 2015 we participated for the second time in the carbon disclosure project cdp an organization that works with companies to disclose their environmental impacts. improving on last year s score of 91 b this year we earned a disclosure and performance score of 97 b. we are members of the hotel carbon measurement initiative along with 23 leading hotel companies. the international tourism partnership and the world travel tourism council wttc formed this initiative to set an industry standard to calculate the carbon footprint of hotel stays and meetings that is informed by the ghg protocol standards. all of our 4 500 hotels are able to report to this standard. we are also members of the wttc climate change task force. the task force is designed to identify industry priority action areas for the future and evaluate industry progress against climate change commitments that were made in 2009. in 2015 wttc released travel tourism 2015 connecting global climate action a report outlining the industry s preparedness to address climate change and progress to date. our environmental e orts have been recognized in 2015 as a forbes top 50 green brand and as a newsweek top green company in the world for our environmental performance. our approach our carbon emissions strategy focuses on the direct and indirect impacts that are most critical to our business. by collecting consistent data across our portfolio we can measure and manage our performance to improve over time. we focus heavily on driving reductions in energy use which has the most in uence on our carbon emissions. we also leverage renewable energy credits and carbon o sets in targeted areas to help reduce our net impact. action reporting through lightstay lightstay our measurement platform helps us understand how our hotels are managing energy and driving improvements over time. since launching lightstay we ve gathered more than ve years of global data that we use to create tools and trainings for hotels and drive greater e ciencies savings and value to our company and owners. with a recent upgrade to lightstay we provide hotels with more information on how to improve energy e ciencies and operational performance which in turn will lower carbon output across our global hotel portfolio. the upgraded system leverages historical data to predict future energy use and resulting cost implications which enables our hotels management groups and owners to adjust their real time behaviors to in uence future performance. we also designed a simpli ed performance dashboard and distributing process for sharing results across the hotel to drive greater engagement. in the future lightstay will also send automatic data alerts and performance tips to hotels. these tips will show hotels how to improve based on successful projects that have been completed at other hotels. carbon o sets carbon o setting is a meaningful option we give our customers. to calculate the carbon footprint of any event at one of our hotels we give our hilton team member and franchise employee sales and marketing teams a meeting calculator tool through lightstay. the tool also provides our customers and hotels with ideas for how to minimize our customers footprint during their stay with us. in may 2015 we expanded our clean air program in an e ort to o set carbon from meetings and events in 92 participating asia paci c hotels and create a value incentive for our guests. we calculate the carbon emissions generated by meetings and events and purchase carbon credits to o set the impact. the credits go toward a program of our customer s choice such as rainforest protection projects in indonesia and australia or wind generated energy projects in india and china. through our clean air program we purchase carbon credits that go toward a variety of di erent organizations reducing greenhouse gas emissions throughout the world. the hyundai cogeneration project in dangjin located in south korea is one of the organizations that we support. it aims to minimize greenhouse gases by converting surplus waste gases at a local steel factory to generate cleaner electricity. this process minimizes air pollution by using waste gas instead of releasing it into the atmosphere. the cleaner electricity is preventing 1. 8 million tons of co2 emissions per year. that is approximately 400 418 olympic swimming pools of co2 gas not entering the atmosphere through the purchase of carbon credits on behalf of our customers hosting meetings and events at our participating properties. clean air program carbon o set credits purchased to o set meetings and events hilton team members include employees of hilton worldwide at corporate o ces owned managed leased and timeshare properties. franchise employees include employees at independently owned and operated franchised properties. while franchisees and their employees are not employed by us they are a large part of our brands and our culture of hospitality. in addition to our corporate responsibility initiatives we o er franchisees training and recognition programs and provide them with other resources that are relevant to them and their businesses. our guests business partners and stakeholders are increasingly looking for transparency expecting more from how companies purchase the goods and services they use. as we expand into new countries where operating norms are less familiar and there can be less transparency around the origin and creation of products we may become exposed to reputational risks potential disruptions in supply and environmental challenges. that s why to continue to contribute to the long term success of our business it is vital to understand the potential social and environmental impacts among our categories of top spend and volume so that we can manage these considerations appropriately and ensure we have the quality products available to meet the needs of our guests. develop programs and initiatives that support business objectives while managing social and environmental impacts in our supply chain. 4 000 suppliers we have more than 4 000 partnerships with women minority and veteran owned businesses resulting in 1 billion of spend with these partners since 2010. 11 major markets we have 40 hotels in 11 major markets in europe latin america and the united states and canada participating in our local sourcing and education programs. 1 400 hotels more than 1 400 hotels across ve brands required to switch all egg usage to cage free eggs by 2017 and gestation free pork by 2018. 100 shark n banned in 100 percent of restaurants and f b facilities in our hotels globally. impact highlights goal introduction opportunities communities environment responsible sourcingas a global hotel company that purchases food and beverage linens amenities beds and energy sourcing is a complex and often decentralized issue. our suppliers extend beyond 97 countries and span multiple industries legal contexts and infrastructure challenges. we depend on safe high quality and a ordable supplies amenities and raw materials to meet the demands of our operations and the expectations of our guests to deliver consistent and exceptional experiences. animal welfare and sourcing as a global operator of food and beverage experiences we share public concerns about the health care and welfare of animals raised for food. with the introduction of our responsible sourcing policy we address opportunities to support the care and welfare of the animals in our extended global supply chain. following the initial removal of shark n from menus across all restaurants and food and beverage facilities operated by managed properties in china and southeast asia we ceased serving shark n across all properties globally in 2014. following this accomplishment hilton singapore became the rst hotel in asia to achieve marine stewardship council and aquaculture stewardship council chain of custody certi cation. to build on this work in 2015 we began collaborating with world wildlife fund wwf to develop a global sustainable seafood approach that will initially prioritize markets based on a number of factors including procurement methods demand for seafood and annual seafood spend. in 2015 we also announced a commitment to switch to cage free eggs by december 31 2017 for all hilton hotels resorts waldorf astoria hotels resorts conrad hotels resorts canopy by hilton and doubletree by hilton hotels. additionally by december 31 2018 all pork products for these properties must be purchased from suppliers that house breeding pigs in groups rather than gestation crates. these changes will initially apply in 19 countries where these products are currently available and will be adopted in additional markets as supply comes online. responsible meetings in 2015 we launched meet with purpose a concept designed to make it easier for meeting professionals to incorporate balanced meals and wellness into meetings and events. meet with purpose encourages meeting and event planners to consider using locally sourced food items that can provide fresh and balanced menu options. our approach for more than a decade we ve cultivated relationships with women and diverse suppliers to use their insights and experience to meet the needs and preferences of our diverse guests. in the last ve years we ve also started examining speci c product categories in more detail beginning with our work in the food and beverage area on shark n and expanding to examine eggs and pork. to build on this work we developed a dedicated role and a cross functional advisory group. collectively this advisory group oversees the development of a comprehensive responsible sourcing strategy across our operations and sets the foundation for integration. it is designed to create further alignment across regions share best practices and guide global decisions related to responsible sourcing. not only are we committed to our own responsible business practices but it is also our goal to make sure that the suppliers providing hilton with goods and services do the same. in 2015 we updated our responsible sourcing policy to reinforce our expectation that our suppliers and partners support and work together with us on our goal of long term sustainable supply by addressing known business environmental and social issues. this year we also conducted an analysis to map areas of highest spend and volume to target potential social and environmental impacts in each product category to prioritize monitor and manage more closely. we will use the results of this study to further focus on de ning goals for our responsible sourcing e orts. action governance while we have sourcing programs that have been in place for years and focus on a variety of products our advisory group will help us scale existing programs uncover new opportunities and share best practices across the portfolio. inclusive sourcing our goal is to forge strong relationships with our wide range of vendors and suppliers that re ect the diversity of our global portfolio of hotels and guests. through our award winning supplier diversity program in the united states we have cultivated relationships with more than 4 000 women minority and veteran owned enterprises. we are currently evaluating ways to evolve our program into other markets. local sourcing hilton team members franchise employees and suppliers also look for local sourcing opportunities and form relationships with area farmers to collect and distribute products to our hotels. we work with suppliers to develop unique trainings for farmers related to the handling safety guidelines and insurance requirements needed to supply our properties. to date we have more than 40 hotels in 11 major cities in europe latin america the united states and canada participating in our local sourcing and education programs. partnerships associations awards certi cations in 2015 we began working with world wildlife fund wwf to support our environmental goals and progress and drive value for our operations. wwf will help us expand our sustainable seafood e orts globally and continue to work with us to evolve our responsible sourcing strategy. through our membership with weconnect international an organization that empowers women business owners to succeed in local and global markets we connect hotels throughout asia with opportunities to consider diverse suppliers in their purchasing decisions. in 2015 we participated for the second time in the carbon disclosure project cdp an organization that helps disclose the greenhouse gas emissions of major corporations. improving

exception is that here we state our continued support for the global compact since this publication also informs the united nations un on our progress regarding the commitments we made throughout the year. our business model proved its resilience in 2017 when we resumed a growth trajectory and further ramping up our investments despite the many challenges on the brazilian macroeconomic front. what drives us is undoubtedly the passion we feel for what we do. we have a sparkle in our eyes a desire to do more and an inability to accept the status quo all of which is what drives us forward. proximity to the customers knowledge of the fashion business and a set of daily practices focused on the simplicity of processes and directed towards operational efficiency are what have allowed us to maximize the opportunities for expansion with the opening of 70 stores during the year. we have also concluded some important projects which will be instrumental in allowing us to move forward and preserve our competitiveness. during the year we completed an important stage in infrastructure investment so that we now have a modern technological platform which will serve as a foundation for integrating the shopping experience in all channels. we began this process with the construction of new distribution centers which allowed us to operate a new logistics model. we then undertook a complete updating of the company s erps and last year concluded the modernization of the e commerce and financial products platforms. these are now ready to offer new functionalities and services in line with leading international benchmarks. all these steps will provide us with greater accuracy and control over inventory promoting productivity gains and greater use of new technologies and

provides us with more agility and flexibility for managing the financial arm of the business. it also gives us a capability to offer new functionalities and services to card holding customers thus fostering improved relationships and interactivity with the renner brand. as for the infrastructural aspect during the year we finalized the replacement of the existing financial products platform for a more modern and flexible one giving us faster connections with internal and external systems. additionally we digitized the processes for granting and recovery of credit providing more convenience and agility to our customers. another key event during the year was the unveiling of the first renner stores outside brazil. as from september we launched our brand in uruguay where we already have three units in operation. this was a key step for testing our business model abroad and for consolidating technological infrastructure and processes. to date prospects are positive in the light of the

and logistics sectors. according to a study presented in 2017 at the national meeting of the construction industry enic civil construction formally employs 2. 2 million people while another 2 million workers are employed through informal contracts meaning they are not covered by the labor law. this is a negative impact risk scenario. this sector is key to our businesses as we have been expanding our operations by opening and remodeling stores at a fast pace for the past few years. in the logistics segment highway transportation of our merchandise is the segment where we identified the highest risk potential due to the sexual exploitation of children on highways. regarding the environment civil construction and logistics are also the key segments with potential for impact. civil construction is one of the sectors that consume the most natural resources from input production to the construction works and operation. moreover civil construction is the activity that generates the most waste accounting for more than 60 of the total in the country according to the brazilian association for the recycling of civil construction and demolition waste abrecon. the logistics and transportation sector intensely consumes fuels and consequently emits a significant amount of greenhouse gas. learn more about our initiatives for environmental impact mitigation in the eco efficiency

of the 2017 ghg emissions inventory for the first time in 2017 we used two methods to calculate our inventory of scope 2 emissions which include electricity we purchased and consume. the location based method considers the location of electricity consumer units and is adopted by the brazilian ghg protocol program for scope 2 emissions. the emission factor used in this method is the average of the emission factors of different electricity generation sources that make up the national interconnected system sin. the market based method reflects emissions from electricity purposefully chosen and uses factors specifically associated with each source we chose to acquire and consume electricity from. it is necessary to prove and trace its origin. for the first time lojas renner s. a. was able to separately account for emissions associated with the acquisition of electricity from renewable sources in the open market. considering the location based method our gross emissions of ghg

10005,12623,mars-2015-pia-summary-english.pdf,principles in action summary 2015 www. mars. comthe five principles 1 10by living up to our principles we deliver growth that we can all be proud of as mars associates grant f. reid chief executive officer office of the president in 2015 for the fifth year in a row mars made the top 25 world s best multinational workplaces list by great place to work mars has been a private business for more than four generations. at the heart of our business success is more than a century s commitment to win win relationships with our stakeholders including consumers customers farmers suppliers and associates. we create opportunities in the course of making products and delivering services to benefit the whole family from delicious occasional treats to wholesome meals to food and healthcare that helps us make a better world for pets. as our business grows we remain committed to operating according to the five principles of quality responsibility mutuality efficiency and freedom. these are not hollow words. they are principles that unite us and serve to guide our business decisions. by living up to our principles we deliver growth that we can all be proud of as mars associates. a good example of something we are proud of is our commitment to sustainability. in 2015 we achieved two remarkable goals to generate zero waste to landfill from all mars manufacturing sites globally and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from our operations by 25 from a 2007 baseline. it s all part of our journey to de carbonize our direct operations by 2040 and we are making great progress. in addition to substantial energy efficiency work at our factories in 2015 our mesquite creek wind farm in texas began generating the equivalent of 100 of the electricity needed to power mars us operations. we ve since launched the moy wind farm in scotland which will generate enough electricity to power all 12 mars sites in the uk. on another front the global obesity epidemic continues to escalate. millions of consumers are concerned about what they eat and how this impacts their health. we must make sure our brands remain relevant in the face of these challenges. for example we fully endorse recommendations on transparent labeling and limiting daily intake of added sugars to no more than 10 of total calories. we re looking at where we can reformulate products to reduce salt fat and sugar without compromising on taste. and we re helping consumers understand which of our products are great everyday options such as whole grains and which products should be limited to occasional treats or indulgences confectionery and chocolate. unfortunately obesity can and does co exist with undernutrition and lack of food security denying many people access to the safe nutrition they need. in 2015 we launched the mars global food safety center. this facility isn t about our next great product development. instead it will foster pre competitive research and training to help raise global food safety standards. it will serve as a resource that can help the food industry provide safe and nutritious food for families all over the world. in addition to this investment in infrastructure and expertise we re proud to partner with governments ngos and health organizations to help improve food safety and security. i ve been a mars associate for more than 28 years. my fellow associates and i take immense pride in our company s culture which reflects our values and a commitment to personal responsibility. i believe recognition of our workplace including being named one of the world s best multinational workplaces is a direct result of that culture and the passion of associates. while we want to give ourselves a chance to celebrate progress we re keenly aware that big challenges remain. we know many of the farmers who grow our raw materials such as cocoa mint rice and tea are not earning a sufficient income. obesity and malnutrition remain global challenges. climate change and a sustainable future for agriculture need to be urgently addressed. but i m optimistic. i m confident that we are making a positive impact by using science based information working in partnerships and empowering associates. i m also certain that if we business government non governmental organizations and society as a whole work together to face our common challenges we can secure a great future for generations to come. thank you for your interest in our journey. we welcome your questions your provocations and your partnership as we aim to deliver growth we are proud of. 2 10petcarewrigleyfoodchocolateshare of total sales by business segment private family owned company 33bnnet salesmore than billion

helps us stay ahead of the rapidly evolving regulatory landscape across all our markets and continue to be an ethical company. more about marshow we engage stakeholders the challenges our company shares with society are too big for any one organization to tackle. but we are determined to be part of the solution. we seek out partners and stakeholders from inside and outside our business to help us develop the most promising solutions. for example external experts advise our board and management team on geopolitical and macroeconomic trends. we access the best possible science through our work with independent scientists in the mars science advisory council. all our segments work with a range of partners to collectively tackle problems that affect our specific categories. in addition senior business leaders serve on the boards of organizations such as the world cocoa foundation and the sustainability consortium. our engagements with the consumer goods forum the sustainable agriculture initiative platform the united nations global compact and other multi stakeholder partnerships help shape our own business strategies while we engage with others on social and environmental challenges. public policy and advocacy we work with governments trade associations regulatory bodies unions and other organizations on issues that are important to our industry society and company. our priority is to focus on issues that have the greatest impact on our business and where we have the most influence including climate change food safety and security health and wellbeing and sustainable agriculture. our policy for participating in political processes provides guidance to all relevant associates on how to engage in line with the five principles. principles in

honest and appropriate for all ages. the mars marketing code details our commitments including our pledge not to market to children under 12 years old. in 2015 we missed this target and 4. 3 of our advertising spots were seen by audiences with more than a quarter children. we re determined to tackle this for example by working more closely with tv companies and being stricter with our checks. 8 10as a global food company it s important we apply rigorous quality and food safety standards to everything we design source and manufacture. without food safety we can t achieve food security a global challenge that will need open collaborative solutions from the whole food industry. our approach quality is one of the five principles. we take pride in and responsibility for making products that delight our consumers families and friends furry and otherwise. our comprehensive quality management process includes detailed quality and food safety controls at every stage. we make the vast majority of our products ourselves but when we use external partners to make our products we require them to meet our strict quality and food safety expectations set out in our external manufacturing quality management standard. we always strive for perfection and our goal is zero product recalls however very occasionally there may be a problem with a product. in these circumstances the safety and trust of our consumers always come first and we never hesitate to recall if required. our focus on food safety isn t just on our products. food safety is one of the fundamentals of food security when all people at all times have access to sufficient safe and nutritious food. focusing on food safety will help drive better access better availability and more nutritious food cutting food waste and saving lives in the process. that s why we re working with multiple partners to break new ground in this area. visit our website to join the conversation on food safety. pioneering global research in food safety in 2015 we opened the mars global food safety center. this first of its kind facility combines our expertise in food safety with the work of over 60 mars partnerships and research collaborations including the world food programme and gain. our research focuses on areas such as managing pathogens analyzing big data and communicating risks. in addition to 25 full time mars associates the center is supporting the work of external researchers and regulators. in april 2016 the center hosted over 100 participants from the food industry academia ngos government agencies for

security. in 2013 we became one of the 10 founding members of the bpnr and we have worked with gain since 2012 to understand and address the link between food safety and food security. today food safety tests look for specific micro organisms or bacteria in raw materials and products. but what if food safety scientists could instead track all of the organisms in a specific environment and understand changes in their behavior to predict food safety risks that s the goal of the ibm mars consortium for sequencing the food supply chain. launched in 2015 the consortium is creating one of the world s most ambitious big data projects aiming to categorize and understand these micro organisms and the factors that influence them. advancing food safety i m really excited about mars global food safety center our new hub for capturing generating and sharing knowledge to help raise standards on global food safety. of course we don t yet have all the answers and we re continuously learning. it s about sharing what we do know and learning more together that s why collaborating with partners is so important. guangtao zhang phd global analytical research manager mars global food

agency epa for our leadership on climate change. according to the epa mars is the sixth largest green power user in the us. and this is only the beginning we recently announced a new wind farm project that will provide the elecricity for our uk operations. evolving as a sustainable business whether in our own operations or deep in our supply chain our business must be built on sustainable practices. it s essential if we are to thrive as a business for generations to come and if generations to come are to thrive. our approach the global threats we face from climate change to resource scarcity affect us all. like you we want to help foster a planet that is healthy and thriving. but first we must evolve our business to be more sustainable. to do this we are aiming to become sustainable in a generation by focusing on the five impacts most relevant to our business land use ghg emissions water use income and human rights. to become sustainable in a generation we are investing in renewable energy improving conditions in our supply chains and speaking out about climate change. and we re working to make sure that the people we rely on from smallholder farmers to

powered by our mesquite creek wind farm our royal canin site in south africa is the first facility ever to be audited to ecocert s ecological areas local biodiversity standard setting the benchmark for global industrial biodiversitywhen setting our ghg targets for our direct operations we didn t simply rely on what s feasible which was probably a 20 30 reduction. we started with the science. and that helped us come up with a target to become carbon neutral by 2040 or sustainable in a generation. we found that a long term target drove new strategies new ideas and innovation making what seemed unachievable possible. zero waste to landfill 100 of our factories now send zero waste to landfill from our direct operations. that means as of december 31 2015 all of our production sites are now completely landfill free 5. this isn t just about reducing pollution. waste can be a valuable resource that can be reused or recycled to make new products or used as an energy source. case study kevin rabinovitch global sustainability director mars incorporated we are making a big effort to be more transparent across our business. we were excited to be recognized by the cdp formerly carbon disclosure project for our work. the organization which assesses companies on measuring managing and disclosing ghg emissions to combat climate change awarded us a score of 98 out of 100 for disclosure and c for performance. talking climate change climate change will affect all of us. as a food and agriculture company mars our suppliers and growers are particularly vulnerable. in 2015 we took part in climate week events urged governments to set climate policies and forged new business collaborations at cop21 in paris. we want to be bold in our ambitions because we know how important this is. and we are encouraging others to collaborate with us so that together we can respond to this imminent challenge and secure our collective future. 10 10to build a complete picture teams travel to origin countries and spend time with suppliers and farmers. in 2015 we visited suppliers and farmers who grow the mint palm oil peanuts rice soy sugar and tomatoes used in our products to name a few. how does this fit with your existing work with suppliers we already collaborate with our suppliers in many ways. through our responsible sourcing program we work with our direct suppliers as they seek to respect rights in their workplaces in alignment with our supplier code of conduct. we engage with suppliers on sourcing beef palm oil paper and board and soy in compliance with our deforestation policy. and we also partner with them on other raw materials for example in the cocoa coffee fish mint and tea supply chains. the mapping work is the next phase in our journey. it s about using a more consistent approach across all raw materials and within our extended supply chains to advance respect for human rights enhance the livelihoods of farmers and workers and improve environmental conditions. our suppliers are critical partners to helping us achieve this. how will mars source its raw materials sustainably like everything at mars our first step is to look at the evidence and science. then we can make plans and set targets to drive benefits for everyone in our value chain. we focus on raw materials with the biggest social and environmental concerns. we ve identified 23 priority raw materials and have been working to understand which of the five sustainability impacts land ghg emissions water income and human rights apply to these raw materials and their supply chains. once we ve mapped these we can then set targets to improve them. how does this mapping actually work it s a big task in 2014 we set up dedicated sustainable sourcing teams to lead this work within our segments. they work closely with our sourcing managers and suppliers to dig down into the supply chain and map it back to origin. sourcing managers need to be part of this journey to ensure they consider sustainability in commercial decisions. our sustainable sourcing teams work with them very closely and train them to carry out supply chain mapping. so far we ve trained 150 sourcing managers in 12 countries. principles in action summary 2015 100 000 35 cocoa farmers reached directly and indirectly through training certification programs working with suppliers and local partnerships of our fish and seafood is now sustainably sourcedpioneering rice sustainability every day rice provides nutrition to nearly half the world s population. but rice farming uses large volumes of water and releases ghg emissions. mars is working with farmers to share best practices for water seed and fertilizer management. mars worked with the sustainable rice platform to develop the first ever global standard for sustainable rice. we ll use it to sustainably source 100 of our rice by 2020. building traceability in palm oil back in 2013 we achieved our target to only source rspo certified palm oil. but we won t get complacent we re always looking for ways to push ourselves to be better. our next step is to map our palm oil supply chain to understand exactly where it comes from and what our social and environmental impacts are. by the end of 2015 86 of the palm oil we used was traceable back to the mill. we ll now work with suppliers to drive sustainability and improve standards in the supply chain. promoting human rights we are committed to respecting and promoting human rights across our value chain. our human rights policy lays out mars approach to identifying mitigating and remedying human rights issues in line with the un guiding principles on business and human rights. we re now in the process of putting the policy into action across the business in collaboration with our partners. kate wylie global sustainability director mars incorporated interview to build a detailed picture of our supply chains and truly understand the challenges

icoc . the key elements of both codes clearly embrace and reflect good industry practices as supported by the montreux document released by the un in 2008 un a 63 467 s2008 636. unity understands the importance of safeguarding the integrity of company personnel and members of local communities and is committed to fulfilling its h umanitarian responsibilities towards all those affected by its

businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights within their sphere of influence unity is an ethical leader in expeditionary environments. we have made it our policy to remain compliant with all rules regulations and legislations in areas where we operate. we value our people our clients and respect the countries in which we operate. before engagement with suppliers venders and clients unity carries out an exhaustive due diligence process designed to ensure compatibility with unity s compliance policies including the ten principles. unity actively supports the humanitarian requirem ents defence and reconstruction of communities in areas of the world that suffer from conflict and natural disaster. with in house capabilities to manage all aspects of shipping aircraft and trucking as well as providing other support services we offer clients a close partnership that addresses their particular needs in fulfilling complex multi disciplined projects in suffering communities. unity offers emergency medical care and shelter in areas that have endured natural disaster. in situations where a natural risk remains we also offer an emergency evacuation service. we recruit local national personnel without discrimination against gender or ethno religious background. as an example across sixteen admin staff in iraq eight are women including two christians. this is further amplified in the mix of kurdish shia and sunni personnel employed on our projects. we aim to reduce inequalities therefore n o set gender or religious faction is recruited rather we embrace a strength comes from the sum of a ll parts approach with the ability to understand and operate in kurdish sunni and shia areas by embracing the knowledge and backgrounds of our employees. principle 2 make sure they are not complicit in human rights abuses unity takes workplace relations seriously. all constituents of unity follow the appropriate labour laws for all countries of operation. where we believe local labour laws do not meet our high standards we strive to offer employees greater working conditions and benefits. unity has a comprehensive group wide occupational health and safety policy and additionally the group has formal specific policies covering areas such as staff welfare risk management health and safety environment and alcohol and drugs abuse. any or all of these are available to staff and all staff are to be fully conversant with these as a condition of their contract. unity s whistle blower policy allows employees and contractors to draw the attention of senior management to any perceived human rights abuse. all expats have background checks prior to completing unity contracts. similarly local national personnel are cleared through the ministry of interior or appropriate govern ment department who check for any background of terrorist or human rights abuses. the welfare of local national employees is constantly reviewed. many of the local nationals working on projects do so at significant risk to themselves and their families. accordingly respect of their privacy and a large strength in unity unity resources group pte ltd unityresourcesgroup. com degree of anonymity is afforded. where an employee indicates they are threatened or are facing hardship all efforts are made to assist them wherever possible. labor standards principle 3 businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining the unity executive team are committed to building an organisation that people want to be a part of. our goal is to have a professional engaged and flexible workforce operating in a successful and positive environment. the responsibility for this is shared by all personnel suppliers and clients. unity has a consultation arrangement which encourages cooperation and engagement of employees and management. this enables all unity employees to voice any concerns over working conditions and rights. recently this initiative led to employees receiving add itional leave time above local labour law requirements in order to respect religious holidays from a variety of cultures. unity understands and respects our employees rights in relation to freedom of association and the right to representation at work including actively allowing our employees to be able to make a free and informed choice about whether to join a union and be represented at work. our projects through promotion of inclusion and active engagement seek feedback from the local national st aff regularly particularly on issues of potential sensitivity. a key element of this is our situational awareness team who act as a compass on cultural and protocol issues in countries of operation. staff are also encouraged to provide feedback via their chain of command or if there is an issue of a sensitive nature then they can approach the project manager directly. a weekly meeting is held where all staff are present and any questions for an open forum response discussion are raised. similar too l box meetings are held by each individual project team. communication is open and honest. feedback is welcomed and acted on. strength in unity unity resources group pte ltd unityresourcesgroup. com principle 4 elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour unity takes a strong standpoint against inhumane labour practices. in all countries of operation unity employs staff in accordance with or above local labour l aws and is fully compliant with the relevant labour codes. unity maintains policies and procedures including employee relations management plans and ind ustrial relations plans. our grievance policy and whistleblower policy also enables any person to report incidents of concern. in each country of operation the unity country director is required to report any incident involving labour irregularities. our group human resources and legal teams oversee the employment and contract process for each and every member of staff. we also employ specialists to further enhance our commitment to maintaining fair labour practices. we are dedicated to being a best practi ce employer. unity is confident that its processes have ensured that all personnel are employed at the will of both the employee and unity in accordance with or above local labour laws. principle 5 effective abolition of child labour unity is against the exploitation of children through direct employment or indirectly. our wider polices flow down to all sub contractors and consultants. country management teams are required to conform to our code of conduct and policies for recruitment. unity s screening and vetting procedures ensures that all staff are of legal employment age. this is confirmed by national id card checks in the country of operation. this process is overseen by unity s group human resource s and legal teams. for example in iraq we ensure that each candidate undergoes a compliance check with the ministry of labour who set a higher minimum age for employment. documents are then further checked by our human resources and in house legal team before contractual and em ployment terms are approved. our contracts in iraq abide by the ira qi ministry of interior laws and ministry of labour laws. we are proud to ensure that all government labour requirements are met and embraced with strict vigilance. no employee comes onto a contract without an appropriate level of experience and training. principle 6 eliminate discrimination in respect of employment and occupation unity believes in equal opportunities and outcomes regardless of nationality or gender. this involves the removal of discrimination and structural inequalities in access to resources opportunities and services and the promotion of equal rights. promoting unity s global indigenous employment strategy aims to promote the development and growth of local industry through increased indigenous employment training and career development opportunities. this embraces local procurement solutions where these strength in

these into account in development planning and programmes. values add to the local economy and do not risk the q uality or timeline of project deliverables. unity actively follow s a stringent recruitment policy which is built on gender equality and the absolute avoidance of discrimination of all kinds. for example we employ over 50 women in various roles across ten countries which we believe is significantly higher than industry norms. we also have a number of women in our senior management team who provide a central role in the strategy and decision making process. similarly the recruitment process for aviation positions is based on skills qualifications experience on aircraft type and security clearance assessment. the process is therefore performance based and is blind to issues of gender sexuality race religious beliefs etc. the environment principle 7 businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges unity is well aware of the impact that the companies activities may have on local communities. as such we recognise the value of engaging with civil society and host and home g overnments to contribute to the welfare of the local community while mitigating any potential for conflict where possible. unity maintains an environmental policy that provides guidance for our programmes and projects. we give strong emphasis to ehs polici es and plans on all projects. for example o ur aviation programme confirms to best industry standards. we are constantly reviewing this procedure to ensure that it remains up to date. unity has received iso 14001 2004 environmental management systems accreditation. the operating environment in iraq is not overly conducive to good environmental practices. the culture of the country is not one of recycling ethical waste removal or even the most basic of environmental education due to conflict since early 2003. unity s contracts in this region try to lead by example by recycling and practicing environmentally friendly waste disposal. strength in unity unity resources group pte ltd unityresourcesgroup. com principle 8 undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility

competently educated and experienced in the appropriate environment. unity keeps track of its training needs associated with environmental aspec ts and will provide continuing training to meet these needs. we have introduced a policy to ensure that all our operations recycle waste where possible. we have advised all operations to print only when absolutely necessary. unity seeks to only use paper companies that are iso 14001 endorsed seeking to reduce the organisations carbon footprint. unity has achieved this by promoting a culture of printing only when absolutely necessary. principle 9 encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies our approach will always consider the environment and community through culturally integrated solutions such as engaging local resources and staff where possible in order to have a positive effect on the local economy and community as well as to minimise our carbon footprint. we provide training and mentoring for local staff to provide project support which in turn leads to a skilled experienced and self sufficient workforce for future employment. innovative technologies are cons idered at our project design stage. we can provide solar photovoltaic solar water heating portable water condenser technology and biomass digesters to our clients in order to reduce the negative impact on the local environment. for example our aviation department is currently researching biofuel use for our aircrafts in the aim for affordable and clean energy. anti corruption principle 10 businesses should work against corruption in all its forms including extortion and bribery unity has a clear policy on unethical behaviours and improper actions and each employee is required to sign a code of conduct. all staff have signed the unity code of conduct and are aware of the effect that unethical behaviour has on the fragile operating environments in w hich unity works. unity has ensured that transparency and compliance is a central theme in the way that we conduct business. for example undergoing audits b y one of the big f our accounting firms as part of our bid to ensure that our business can demonstrate complete financial transparency. strength in unity unity resources group pte ltd unityresourcesgroup. com by nature of the clients we work for anti corrupt practices are at the forefront of our operations. unity has a no gifts policy which exte nds to our personnel and their interaction with local authorities. we do not exchange gifts or favours to local agencies or any other party. fur thermore a culture of being a good corporate citizens is encouraged. by abiding by local rules and laws co mpleting correct and proper paperwork following all steps in application processes and only paying applicable fees as opposed to any unexplained add on we minimise corrupt practices and being unwittingly a party to it. strength in unity unity resources group pte ltd unityresourcesgroup. com measurement and outcomes all country directors and senior managers must achieve a board endorsed key performance indicator kpi concerning the active implementation of unity s c ode of conduct and csr program including the ten principles. regular manage ment meetings take place to outline and review unity s policies and procedures. this process also highlights shortfalls and areas for improvement. guidelines for corporate social responsibility targets are formulated at board level with the input of senior management a nd circulat ed accordingly. the results of our quantitative qualitative assessment is communicated to all stakeholders annually so that the organisation and other interested parties can track our performance. this enables us to foster a corporate environment of tra nsparency and accountability. conclusion unity values being a participant in the un global compact. we believe that our active participation reflects our commitment to align operations and strategies with universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights labour environment and anti corruption. unity continually measures its activities and those of its personnel suppliers venders and clients against the ten principles as part of our wider csr programme. in addition more than one of the sd gs such as gender equality reducing inequalities and affordable and clean energy are currently part of unity s business model. the measurement of unity s activities in relation to the ten principles and sdgs is done through regular reporting from count ry managers and senior managers board meetings and a questionnaire sent to our entire staff. the results help to identify areas of improvement. overall our corporate ethos is integrally structured towards minimising negative influence and maximising pos itive impact in the areas in which we operate. unity resources group makes no representations or warranties with respect to the contents or use of this document

agrokor group operates in the entire adria re gion. in terms of the significance of business opera tions croatia slovenia serbia and bosnia and herze govina are the company s primary markets. in these markets agrokor achieves results and impacts that are considered particularly important in terms of sustainability. in the retail business group a category management func tion was put in place for the purpose of ensuring adequate commercial goods supply management. different teams have thus been assigned responsibility for different groups of products. these teams perform all activities related to the relevant group of products from negotiating the terms of sale and prices to determining the required amounts and similar. the central procurement function is responsible for all goods and services supplied for the group s own purposes. these supplies are used by a large number of group com panies and have been recognized as the goods and servic es that are best supplied centrally because in doing so the group takes advantage of the impact of quantity. the cen trally procured goods include for example energy sources vehicles and equipment while the centrally procured ser vices include for example communication security main tenance and cleaning services. the goal of the central pro curement function is to create synergy effects for the benefit of group companies by arranging the purchase of particu lar goods under more favorable terms compared to those that individual group companies could negotiate in the market acting independently. in order to arrange the most favorable terms for the group companies in its negotiations with sup pliers central procurement emphasizes its need for substan tial volumes. non commercial goods used by only one or a small number of group companies are supplied independent ly through local procurement departments. considering the large volume of retail operations per formed within the group it is not surprising that agrokor co operates with a large number of suppliers at the regional and particularly at the national level. in 2015 the group cooper ated with more than six thousand suppliers. pursuant to its business policy the agrokor group al ways strives to cooperate with suppliers that use ecological ly acceptable and environmentally friendly energy sources. supplier values perceived by the group as advantages include efforts to ensure reduction of pollution and adverse environ mental impacts human and labor rights protection and sim ilar. if the competitiveness criterion is met agrokor prefers to include in its supplier portfolio the suppliers that foster sustainability as one of their core values. a portion of the group s electricity supplies refers to zel en green energy a type of electricity produced by hep opskr ba exclusively from renewable sources at hydro power plants. supply chain g4 3 16 countries where the organization operates the agrokor group cooperates with more local than foreign suppliers. although guided by the principle of com petitiveness at all times it s in line with the group s policy to give preference to local suppliers thus encouraging com plete quality and solid growth and development in the mar ket where it operates. considering its engagement in various fields of busi ness each of which is characterized by distinctive features agrokor operates with different types of suppliers. in order to ensure the most favorable scenario for the group agrokor and agrokor companies insist on establishing business rela tionships with entities that are in terms of the distribution channel as close to the source as possible i. e. the producer itself. if such business process organization is not possible agrokor and agrokor companies also cooperate with various agents wholesalers subcontractors and distributors. because of the complexity and diversity of individual group companies and the fact that they operate in different sectors the group s supply chain is rather diversified. while the retail operations of the group are very labor intensive the fmcg part on the other hand is rather capital intensive and high tech oriented. the agrokor group fosters lasting and stable relations with all its key suppliers since they represent our ex ceptionally important business partners. we should note that compared to the previous period there were no ma terial changes that affected the supply chain in 2015. the group maintained its existing supply chain structure and or ganization since it is founded on solid foundations and en sures satisfaction of all partners involved. significant changes relating to the supply chain during the reporting period membership in local and international organizations and associations hup croatian

identified material aspects and boundaries all business entities listed in annex 1 business struc ture of the agrokor group are included in the con solidated financial statements of the agrokor group. defining the report content and aspect boundaries the application of the g4 sustainability reporting guidelines has allowed group companies more freedom in identifying material aspects compared to the require ments of the previous version of gri guidelines. the reporting teams initially met at the training in the implementation of new guidelines that was based on the application of the re porting principles for defining report content after which they proposed the indicators they considered material to their operations. thereafter two more rounds of consultations were held across group companies in order to make the final iden tification of material business aspects and the selected mate rial aspects were revised once more after the 2014 un global compact annual report had been prepared. the entire process was greatly supported by concerted efforts of colleagues from entities included in the organization s consolidated financial statements groups of related companies e. g. the frozen food production segment encompasses four companies which helped deter mine the specific features common to a particular segment while also taking into consideration the distinctive features of each individual company in it. material aspect boundaries have been determined on the basis of the estimated impacts of group companies and their materiality to the identified stakeholder groups. envi ronmental aspect boundaries were therefore determined as the immediate environment of the point of impact. it can therefore be asserted that such environmental impacts are limited to the local level except for the impacts of energy production which have a global dimension because it gener ates greenhouse gas emissions. the economic and social as pects of the agrokor group are limited to the region in which the group companies perform their activities. in order to improve the reporting process in the next period agrokor will define particular goals for different ar eas and regularly report on the related goal achievement progress. we believe that in doing so we will facilitate the management of our operations and ensure that the activities performed to achieve the set goals and their contribution to sustainability of operations are presented in a more trans parent way. the following material aspects have been identified economic impacts procurement practices materials energy water biodiversity only belje emissions effluents and waste compliance transport overall employment labor management relations occupational health and safety training and education diversity and equal opportunity equal remuneration for men and women labor practices grievance mechanisms non discrimination human rights grievance mechanisms freedom of association and collective bargaining local communities compliance customer health and safety products and services labeling compliance 12g4 24 27 stakeholder engagement i n accordance with our sustainable development strategy and the key aspects of the same the content of the report was defined in consultation with agrokor s most important stakeholder groups. stakeholder inclusion still represents as in the case of most reporting companies a special challenge. although the companies are in everyday contact with various stakeholder groups and thus continuously maintain a certain level of communication with the same it is quite challenging to achieve a good response to a special invitation for consul tation purposes. stakeholder engagement therefore remains an area where further intensive efforts are required to get an understanding of the needs of the stakeholders we find rele vant for our operations as well as to make them more famil iar with the logic behind certain of our business decisions. it is only through transparent communication that we can get an understanding necessary to achieve such business devel opment that also meets the needs of the stakeholder groups that the companies are associated with. just like in our previous reports we provide information on various stakeholder groups that agrokor companies have defined in their separate mission and vision statements as es sential for their operations and success. due to our mutual in terests and the wish to better understand each other we try to keep regular contacts with the following stakeholder groups customers customers are an extremely important stakeholder group for all agrokor companies. their comments collected through various surveys make the basis for improvement of our existing products and development of new ones. we adjust the products and services to the needs of our customers and changes in their habits and trends. we dedicate special attention to the quality of our products. for that purpose we have made free customer phone lines available to our customers in all our companies as well as ensured that the customers have the opportunity to submit their suggestions and comments via electronic mail and online interface. in addition customer cards are used to follow the habits and needs of individual customers. based on such information our retail chains design special deals discounts and benefits for their customers. employees agrokor companies always emphasize and prove that employees are their most valuable resource. by providing opportunities for continuous advancement and additional education as well as through career development planning we try to motivate our employees and increase their satisfaction and efficiency. in return we expect them to demonstrate the highest standards of excellence. our employees from all levels are actively involved in the process of proposing and creating improved solutions and their working environment offers them opportunities for continuous business and personal development. trade unions once again we are proud to emphasize that agrokor companies are the first companies in croatia that have integrated collective bargaining in their business models for managing relationships with employees and unions. we apply the same practices in other countries in the region as well subject to local laws and regulations however. at agrokor companies trade unions are involved in the decision making process through workers councils and they also have an opportunity to supervise company operations through memberships in supervisory boards. the agrokor group supports and finances charity educational and sporting activities responding to trade union initiatives. suppliers and partners we cooperate closely with our suppliers and partners in order to create values for our customers and stakeholders that are adjusted to their needs. joint commitment to sustainable development and compliance with the highest quality standards are the core requirements set for agrokor companies and they also apply to the partners that we cooperate with. through intensive cooperation we create and improve business relationships thus contributing to the achievement of direct business results and long term goals associated with sustainable development. shareholders and financial institutions the long term strategy of the managements of agrokor companies is directed towards increasing the value of shareholder capital. we have been earning the trust of our shareholders investors and financial institutions for years confirming our dedication to creating new values on the basis of our results. through regular reporting and making sure that information about our business operations is available to all our stakeholder groups as well as through mutual interaction with the same we ensure that mutual needs and demands are satisfied and we build trust which is the cornerstone of our relationships. local and central authorities each agrokor company is closely associated with the environment in which it operates because it participates in its development and efforts aimed at raising the quality of living in the same by employing local population and paying local contributions. as one of the largest business entities in the region the agrokor group carries additional responsibility to create a transparent fair and motivating business environment. our employees and companies continuously cooperate with all relevant institutions in the countries where we operate and provide the required professional assistance and expertise depending on the requirements and needs of the state institution concerned. through our dialogue with local 13and central authorities we help create business conditions for the benefit of all interest groups. community the agrokor group is closely associated with the communi ties in which we create new economic value. participation in local initiatives is therefore integrated in our corporate cul ture. through various activities our employees impact com munity development and contribute to raising the quality of living in their respective communities and propose financ ing of activities they consider truly important. such activi ties are primarily associated with charity protection of cul tural heritage preservation of environmental resources art and culture and projects pertaining to children and youth. by being actively involved in the activities carried out in their local communities our employees and companies con tribute to further development of the same at all levels and in all spheres where such efforts are required. in that way we help create a positive and sustainable business and living environment. let us mention as one of the examples of our interac tion with our stakeholders the situation when a citizen of za the early delivery of goods to the nearby store which usually started at 5 45 a. m. disturbed the night rest of the people liv ing in the vicinity thus significantly affecting the quality of living of the tenants of her and the neighboring buildings. in response to the complaint and respecting the wishes of the time to after 8 a. m. but also reduced the number of deliver ies to the relevant store by optimizing the arrangement of transported goods. ducer allowing the participants to hold a domestic products fair with a sales exhibition in a specially decorated space in more than 50 exhibitors. the smallest companies and fami ly farms thus got an opportunity to present themselves to a domestic production and often and gladly gathers small pro ducers that make the finest traditional products in its stores. this type of support gives the small producers an oppor tunity to present themselves to a large number of visitors and acquire new buyers. producers of traditional delicacies such as honey wine cheese meat and meat products sweets eco cosmetics and handiwork come from all parts of croatia the efforts to preserve the traditional way of producing food and other products. customers are an extremely important stakeholder group for all agrokor companies. their comments collected through various surveys make the basis for improvement of our existing products and development of new ones. 14g4 28 33 our sustainability report contains consolidated data for the entire group presenting a set of indicators asso ciated with economy employment workforce human rights community and product responsibility. environmen tal indicators are once again presented separately for each company in order to allow comparison with the data from previous reports as well as keep their material value and rel evance. in doing so we have allowed monitoring of environ mental impacts of each presented agrokor company in this reporting

s management board adopted the corporate business principles and the cor porate governance principles. both documents are available at agrokor s website group mission vision and corporate values agrokor compa nies listed on the stock exchange and agrokor as an umbrella company have also adopted the code of ethics in business of the croatian chamber of commerce. in the wider sense business ethics integrate the rules about what is considered good or bad fair or unfair and mor al or immoral in a company s business environment. busi ness actions are judged in accordance with the general eth ical standards of the society and not a special set of norms that can be interpreted in different ways. agrokor has made the strategic decision to operate in a socially responsible manner. the employees are required to pledge adherence to ethical principles simply because non eth ical strategies and behaviors are incompatible with the defini tion of socially responsible business. agrokor s social respon sibility strategy is based on socially beneficial activities for which the group sets aside both money and time with the aim of increasing the quality of life in the communities where it operates through various humanitarian campaigns environ mental protection or improvement campaigns working envi ronment improvement initiatives and similar. in performing its business operations agrokor devotes a significant amount of attention to the issue of corruption as a harmful social phenomenon that undermines core social values. corruption jeopardizes the rule of law undermines the trust in public institutions and legal state fairness equality and safety of its citizens. corruption particularly reduces cost efficiency and effectiveness. agrokor wishes to get actively involved in the fight against corruption. one of the ways to do so is to ensure employee education and adopt internal rules that will apply to all agrokor s employees and all third persons associated with agrokor in any way whatso ever. we believe that in doing so we can eliminate the risks we could be exposed to in our operations as well as pave the road to successful business development in the future. agrokor and its associated companies offer a wide range of services and products on markets in different coun tries. all employees are required to be familiar with and un derstand the laws and regulations relevant for their work re sponsibilities and obligations as well as the regulatory re quirements relevant for doing business in particular markets. employees are required to comply with

with the company s internal acts refrain from harmful and competitive actions as well as make efforts to protect the image and good reputation of agrokor their colleagues buyers and business partners

must treat their colleagues buyers and business partners with respect and maintain a relationship with them which is based on kindness and fairness. the em ployees must avoid all discriminatory types of behavior and respect the personal integrity and dignity of all those they come in contact with in performing their business activities. 18the employees must be ready to share their knowledge with their colleagues and consistently comply with health and safety at work regulations. an employee who experiences problems in claiming the rights guaranteed to him her under a law and or other internal act must inform his her immediate superior man ager about such problems who will then be responsible for taking all the necessary steps in order to eliminate the obsta cles preventing the relevant employee from claiming his her guaranteed rights within the scope of available possibilities. non compliance with the said rules may result in im plementation of disciplinary measures even termination of employment. all the required measures will be carried out by the human resources department in cooperation with the responsible manager or director. anti corruption activities and measures are aimed at setting up agrokor s business standards pertaining to the prevention of corruption. the defined rules refer to all agrokor employees and the operations and activities agrokor performs in all countries where it operates. g4 56 ethics and integrity agrokor and its employees may not promise offer give or approve directly or indirectly a bribe or any kind of val ue to anyone including government officials workers or rep resentatives government owned or government controlled companies private persons or workers of any business entity in order to improperly influence the actions or decisions of such person with the aim of achieving retaining or ensuring any kind of inappropriate benefit for agrokor. just as it is forbidden to offer a bribe to government officials it is also forbidden to bribe private persons or com panies. under no circumstances may an employee of agrokor offer promise give or pay any kind of value in return for an inappropriate benefit. in addition to its employees agrokor often engages other persons to perform its business activities. with the aim of ensuring successful prevention of corruption ade quate measures must be taken in selecting third persons and it must be ensured that they are not giving bribes or com mitting any other type of illegal activities in relation with agrokor s business activities. it is therefore necessary to be particularly careful when engaging and selecting third par ties and determining their fees as well as ensure that their activities are adequately monitored. 19category economic 20in spite of the unfavorable climatic and macroeconomic conditions agrokor was able to maintain its sales revenues and profitability at stable levels while the consolidated results were mainly influenced by the acquisition of mercator. this reporting period was marked by extremely bad weather particularly in the spring and summer of 2014. such unfavorable weather conditions caused large scale flooding in the entire area of our primary mar kets namely croatia bosnia and herzegovina and serbia and also had an adverse effect on the tourist season in croa tia. moreover the macro economic conditions remained un favorable with the gdp trend continuously dropping thus adding pressure on consumption. at the consolidated level total sales revenues increased in from retail operations in total revenues of the agrokor group. in 2014 agrokor companies continued implementing the strategy that focuses on increasing and or maintaining market shares by implementing proactive measures such as efficient marketing and promotional campaigns investments in prices continuous innovation production program expan sion and private brand offer development. the management put a strong focus on cost and business process optimization increasing efficiency and profitability while continuing the process of systematization reorganization and improved uti lization of mutual synergies within the group. in the second half of 2014 after the acquisition of mercator agrokor strong ly focused on the integration of mercator s business processes in the operations of the rest of the group companies. in 2015 agrokor managed to increase its market shares. all the companies within the food production and distribution business group have maintained their leading positions while the companies within the retail and whole sale business group increased their market shares due to the acquisition of mercator. further regulation and adjustment of pricing policies and marketing activities campaigns and innovative solutions and a sales offer adjusted to all envi ronments in which the group operates have additionally strengthened agrokor s retail business. the year was signif icantly marked by the acquisition of mercator while the ac tivities were mainly directed to further integration with the emphasis on achieving synergies. the weather conditions that significantly affect the consumption of ice cream water and drinks improved after a long time and thus contributed to the activities of the teams working in the food business group and the successful real ization of plans. agrokor s agricultural companies managed to achieve profitability growth despite the market develop ments which resulted in oversupply and significant reduction in prices of all commodities and therefore all categories of agricultural products as well. at the consolidated level total sales revenues increased ing an increase of 40. 1. ebitda increased by 33. 2 reach from retail business in total revenues of the agrokor group. category

finally the difference in this reporting period extreme floods in 2014 demon strated the scale of the possible impact of climatic chang es on economy. not only that the floods have affected all our primary markets and thus directly influenced the possi bility of producing food and raw materials for the food indus try but they also adversely impacted the tourism sector that consequently recorded a significantly smaller turnover that year. the weather conditions were much more favorable in 2015 but it will nevertheless be remembered as an extraor dinarily challenging year for the agricultural sector because of the decrease in the price of almost all commodities sanc tions against russia affecting the agricultural goods in the eu and the resulting imbalance of global supply demand of almost all agricultural products. as far as agricultural production is concerned we have continued preparing investments for growing vegetables in closed spaces greenhouses which we plan to realize using non refundable eu funds in the next period. the investments in public irrigation infrastructure are under the control of in stitutions from the public sector. more precisely most of the p ursuant to the regulations applicable in the countries where we operate all employees are registered with the state pension fund. in the republic of croatia the pen sion contribution rate still amounts to 20 and depending on the age of the insured refers to either mandatory pillar i pen sion insurance which amounts to 15 and voluntary pillar ii pension insurance which amounts to 5 of the base used to calculate the contribution. pension contributions are paid by employers in the name and at the cost of the employee. in serbia the employees are registered with the state retirement and disability fund. 14 of the employee s gross salary is paid into the fund at the cost of the employee and another 12 at the cost of the employer. in bosnia and herzegovina all em ployees are registered with the federal pension and disability 18. 5 at the cost of employees in republika srpska serb re public. according to the provisions of collective agreements and general acts the employees are entitled to a bonus on their base salary for each effective year of insurance. at the time of retirement pursuant to the collective agreement and general acts workers in croatia are entitled to a severance pay in the amount envisaged under the income tax regulations i. e. up to three monthly salaries paid prior to termination of employment. the entitlement to jubilee bonus es is approved on the basis of continued service for the same employer in the duration of full 10 15 20 25 30 35 and 40 years without discontinuations. the conditions of entitlement and the amount of the jubilee bonus are determined on the basis of collective agreements and are paid in the maximum non taxable amount determined in accordance with the appro priate regulations of the ministry of finance. retiring work ers in serbia are paid a non taxable severance pay determined in the amount of two monthly salaries. in the federation of bosnia and herzegovina severance pay amounts to last 3 net salaries as published in the statistical bulletins. in republika srpska severance pay amounts to last 3 net salaries paid. large irrigation projects are implemented by counties and are expected to be executed with generous support from the ru ral development fund. however no tenders for such projects were announced in the reporting period. the existence of the public infrastructure is a precondition for the implementa tion of the irrigation system by plots of individual agricultur al producers. our agricultural companies have improved the possibility of irrigation on their own plots by investing in dig ging wells and purchasing appropriate pump stations to cut the cost of irrigation in crop and vegetable farming. by the end of 2015 we invested in five biogas plants through proper disposal of all types of by

in more energy efficient production equipment and participation in cooperation projects with the scientific community. the data presented in the table below refer exc lusively to financial assistance and support received by agro kor companies in croatia and slovenia. it is important to note that the government is not di rectly present in the ownership structure of any of agrokor companies. at the beginning of 2015 the first call for applications for non refundable grants for rural development from the eu ropean agricultural fund was announced. four agrokor com panies zvijezda pik vrbovec agrolaguna and vupik submi tted their applications and were awarded grant funds in the total amount of hrk 40. 3 million. these amounts are not pre sented in the table above since the said funds will only be paid out if it is established that the implementation of the relevant investment projects complies with eu regulations. a as far as the ratio of the minimum entry level wage in our companies in relation to minimum wages paid in the countries where we operate is concerned it can be asserted that in all the relevant countries we offer higher en try level wages compared to the minimum guaranteed wage. in 2014 the minimum gross wage in the republic of croatia amounted to hrk 3 017. in our companies the min imum entry level wage paid to women was at least 13. 9 higher while the minimum entry level wage paid to men was even 14. 3 higher. in 2015 the minimum gross wage in the republic of croatia amounted to hrk 3 029. in our compa nies the minimum entry level wage paid to

minimum since mercator slovenija and mercator crna gora two companies that have not been integrated into agrokor s retail business group were acquired only in the fall of 2014. we have therefore maintained the conditions as we found them in those companies. the minimum gross wage in slovenia is eur 790 while the minimum gross wage in montenegro is eur 288. 05. 23n all labor markets where agrokor companies operate we apply the principles of recruitment and local employ ment. through our official and non official activities we also continuously recognize and point at the challenges and new solutions pertaining to national and local employment policies. we participate in career days and job fairs and ac tively support the development and needs of the communities where we operate by employing local population and purchas ing local products and services. as a result of such approach most employees in our companies are hired from the local com munity both those working at entry level and senior manage ment positions. the agrokor group has the advantage of being inter regionally and internationally present which ensures our employees numerous opportunities for inter location develop ment and advancement regardless of whether it refers to diffe rent towns regions within the country or countries. in the structure of our senior management both high and middle level there are employees who have assumed po sitions in other towns or countries where the group opera tes as a result of career development promotion within the system or personal reasons. a certain number of our speciali sts and experts not necessarily members of the management transfer their expertise and competences from their domicile company to support the operations of other companies within the agrokor group working at such locations for a specific period of time or as needed until specific investments or pro jects are completed and similar. we see such opportunities as additional employee development possibilities. ec6 proportion of senior management hired from the local community at significant locations of operation s ince the agrokor group is the largest private compa ny in this part of europe it is not surprising that our operations result in certain indirect economic impacts. over the years agrokor has invested significant funds in ag ricultural development. in doing so it did not only increase the yields on its own fields and farms but has indirectly by transferring its expertise to contractors influenced their pro gress and improvement as well. by demanding an

suppliers for all types of goods that we place in the market. in this manner the suppliers get an opportunity for a sta ble business growth. indirect impacts include encouragement to development and new hiring which contributes to the strengthening of the local economy. strong local suppliers are key to the growth of the agrokor group as they continu ously support agrokor companies with their developed sales and after sales networks. when entering new markets such as the slovene mar ket through the acquisition of ps mercator agrokor makes sure that local suppliers of acquired companies are taken care of. it maintains good business relationships with such enti ties thus additionally improving their operations in the local market and introducing them to other markets in which the group companies are present. there are of course certain ex ceptions in procurement practices. since agrokor strives to ensure high quality standards 80 of industrial equipment is procured from the leading

environmental management systems ems were given significant new improvements in 2014 and 2015. these improvements were confirmed by attain ing the environmental targets and implementing environ mental programs and resulted in reduction of adverse envi ronmental impacts and pollution i. e. reduction of waste gen eration reduced use of raw materials water and energy and increased levels of knowledge responsibility safety and read iness in ordinary and extraordinary situations. this sustain ability report provides an overview of the systems relevant to the critical g4 gri environmental impact indicators in 25 companies in five countries croatia bosnia and herzegovina macedonia slovenia and serbia. during this reporting period agrokor s companies were awarded two new environmental management system certificates according to the iso 14001 2004 international standard. in may of 2014 kikindski mlin a. d. was awarded its first iso 14001 certificate as well as nova sloga d. o. o. in may of 2015. the system implemented in kikindski mlin resulted in significant improvements in waste management and ex cellent instructions for employees and visitors providing an overview of the entire integrated management system which may serve as a role model for all other companies. nova slo ga was awarded certificates for both its plants the mg mi vela natural mineral water bottling plant and the refriger ation plant. improvements are also noticeable in systematic waste management better monitoring and higher safety lev els. in addition nova sloga optimized its technological pro cesses and enlarged it production capacities at the mg mi vela plant thus quickly achieving savings of electricity per liter of finished product in this reporting period. the acquired mercator d. d. is the first retail company in slovenia and the entire region to be awarded an iso 14001 certificate back in 2009 with very impressive professional environmental pro rajevski kiseljak d. d. dijamant

konzum d. o. o. of saraje vo completed these audits in 2015. the other companies suc cessfully completed their scheduled surveillance audits. to day 21 agrokor companies use environmental management systems ems certified according to the world s most prom inent environmental standard iso 14001 2004. these certif icates symbolically referred to as green emeralds confirm the establishment of high business criteria which if proper ly set up bring significant improvements and have thus be come an important tool for better management of companies. iso 14001 is a fundamental environmental management sys tem in agrokor s companies underlying all other standards directly or indirectly associated with environmental matters. energy efficiency is an integral part of the environmen tal management system. the purpose of systematic energy ef ficiency management according to iso 50001 2011 is to ad ditionally improve management efficiency use and consump tion. we thereby aim to minimize our greenhouse gas emis sions and other adverse environmental impacts as well as our costs. three agrokor s companies zvijezda d. d. jamnica d. d. and pik vrbovec d. d. received their first iso 50001 2011 energy efficiency certificates in late 2015. their energy man agement systems were effectively integrated with the exist ing underlying systems. pik vinkovci d. d. successfully passed its first certifi cation audit of its occupational health and safety systems ac cording to the requirements of the ohsas 18001 2007 in ternational standard in november of 2014 and has thus be come the fifth company within the agrokor group system to comply with ohsas. risks were identified and assessed for each position and made available to each employee and meas ures were undertaken for risk minimization whereby the em ployees were made aware of the risks at their respective work places for the purpose of additionally reducing the number of workplace injuries. another pik industrial agricultural sys tem within our system pik vrbovec d. d. played an impor tant role and provided assistance and coordination in the im plementation of ohsas once again highlighting our internal synergies and knowledge transfer. pik vrbovec and pik vink ovci are an excellent example of first class management of a company where individual systems are highly effective. in 2015 belje d. d. pik

generations. numerous statutory audits were conducted in agrokor s companies integrated ippc audits environmen tal protection water protection occupational safety and fire protection sanitary audits etc. . no cases of legal noncom pliance were found while minor objections concerning non conformities were responded to by taking quick and effec tive corrective measures so no fines of non monetary sanc tions were imposed. the general conclusion arising from the findings of independent inspectorates certification audits and banking trade institutions is in compliance with the rel evant statutory and all other requirements. this compliance allows for the control of all environmental and environmen tal impact aspects. the environmental regulations relevant to agrokor s companies in croatia in this reporting period included the environmental permit regulation official ga zette no. 08 2014 the project environmental impact assess ment regulation official gazette no. 61 2014 the energy efficiency act official gazette no. 127 2014 and the large enterprise energy auditing ordinance official gazette no. 123 2015. such regulations in serbia and slovenia include the integrated environmental pollution prevention and con trol act official journal of the republic of serbia 135 2004 and 25 2015 and the waste regulation official journal of the republic of slovenia no. 37 2015 respectively. companies prepare their environmental reports on an individual basis. such reports are an excellent mechanism for controlling the effectiveness of ems because they deter mine the positive and negative shifts in company s activities relating to environmental protection and beyond in a simple accurate and measurable manner. the preparation of these reports confirms a higher level of systematic management in a company and is also used as a tool for making new improve ments in future periods. in 2014 twelve of our companies prepared the envi ronmental report 2013 dijamant

mental management system. the environmental training processes were very intensive during the relevant period. in addition to important external training courses attended by our employees we will highlight our in house training course held exclusively for our employees. most of the trainers were also our employees so we once again made positive use of the synergies enabled by the size of our group. in 2014 some forty executives from seventeen agrokor s companies in croatia received training in align ment of the environmental management system with the new legislation of the republic of croatia. during that same year training was provided on the preparation of sus tainability reports according to the g4 gri guidelines for all agrokor s companies. in early 2015 training was provided for agrokor s companies in serbia with respect to the alignment of the environmental management system with the environ mental legislation applicable in serbia. the training included lectures about the emas eco management audit scheme certificate and about the upcoming iso 14001 audit. in early 2015 in zagreb we provided an in house training on the sub ject of more efficient energy management process optimiza tion and cost minimization energy management system and the iso 50001 international energy management standard for all our large enterprises. agrokor futura academy continued with its programs. in 2015 four groups of our employees learned amongst other topics about environmental protection management systems and sustainable development. this is a program designed for young employees of the group that gives them an opportuni ty to acquire new knowledge and quickly learn about the most important elements of agrokor group. we will highlight the second edition of the agrokor environmental protection days held in pore in may of 2015. the three day event was attended by 56 experts coming from 28 agrokor group companies. this year the lectures were subject specific and mostly associated with the defining and attaining of environmental targets including as many as fourteen lectures from the agrokor group system and three external ones. co2 print of montenegro presented a successful carbon footprint pilot project with our jamnica while a partnership of the cleaner production center of serbia and the croatian cleaner production center presented the possibility of achieving more feedstock efficient and cleaner production as a path toward sustainable development. we also heard an excellent motivational lecture given by the famous highest seven summits in the world on all continents. we will also mention the presentation of agrokor s e kolektor d. o. o. company to agrokor s companies. as a com pany specializing in waste management e kolektor

the croatian chamber of economy giu pak economic interest grouping for packaging and environmental protection eko ozra and other institutions. we are now in our fourth year of collecting plastic bot tle caps in agrokor companies in croatia for the benefit of the croatian leukemia and lymphoma patients association. this is a humanitarian campaign intended to improve the lives of leukemia and lymphoma patients but also to improve the sep aration of this type of waste which used to end up in munic ipal waste. in 2014 and 2015 our companies made numerous im provements in the area of environmental protection. profes sionally managed environmental protection yields results many interesting projects were designed within agrokor s in tegrated systems. at the fifth national socially responsible business conference held on 25 march 2014 at the esplanade hotel in zagreb ledo d. d. won an indeks dop award for 2013. thanks to adhering to high production quality and inno vation standards but also those relating to environmental management ledo was included in the prestigious list of award winners in the responsible environmental manage ment policies and practices category. that same year forty ledo s drivers completed eco driving training aiming to re duce fuel consumption and co2 emissions. in 2014 irida suc cessfully had its new fssc food safety system certifica tion 22000 system certified. frikom reassembled their heat ing line in a part of the factory which significantly reduced waste storage area as part of a project associated with the ex ports of fish to eu member states. in cooperation with the croatian cleaner production center and unido s consultants jamnica completed its low carbon technologies project. the project aims to provide best practice examples for low carbon lc technologies in selected southeast european companies. co2 print of monte negro completed a successful carbon footprint pilot project for carbonated natural mineral water also with jamnica. in addi tion fifty jamnica s drivers completed eco driving training. sarajevski kiseljak built and put into service an al kali regeneration plant which provided savings of alkali

storage area. fony di reduce the weight of their secondary packag ing materials and reconstructed their cip unit. roto dinamic began to systematically track their waste management and appointed their environmental officer. the belje business complex in mitrovac baranja is an example of successful synergy because the largest dairy farm in croatia provides part of the materials necessary to make bi ogas the agrokor energija biogas plant produces electric ity and heat and the greenhouse uses heat to grow tomatoes on a year round basis. beside all this the farm also includes a solar power plant. belje s dairy factory put into service an equalization pool and started to use gas at five pig farms. a 2 mw biogas plant next to the popovac farm in belje was also put into service. agrokor energija built two more biogas plants vinka within the eponymous plant near vinkovci and vupik completed the process of obtaining a number of water management licenses which were issued for all sites. the implementation of a quality management system accord ing to iso 9001 2015 is in its final stage. the primary energy source at the sopot site within pik vinkovci was replaced by a more environmentally more acceptable energy source pellets thus reducing co2 emis sions. improvements are also noticeable in remote facilities at pik vinkovci we will highlight the roofing of the diesel fuel the scope of their ems to their sales centers osijek and ri jeka reconstructed part of the internal sewage system and commissioned a wastewater treatment plant. in early 2014 pik vrbovec also obtained an integral

included in the system 12 super konzum stores 12 maxi konzum stores two velpro cen ters and 49 small stores. management systems had been im plemented in all former mercator stores iso 140001 and iso 22000. in 2015 each mercator store received an iso 14001 certificate while 12 super konzum stores and three velpro centers received iso 22000 certificates. some of the mercator stores had implemented and certified haccp systems but had not received an iso 14001 certificate with respect to environ mental protection their business was in compliance with the statutory requirements but the system was not formally cer tified. in august of 2015 the kozmo stores which had also implemented environmental management and food safety sys tems were merged into konzum s system their systems will be certified in 2016. kozmo conducted their business in com pliance with the relevant legislation but their management systems were not implemented or certified. konzum continues to improve its services and intro duce innovations as confirmed by the management systems implemented and certified during the past period. an iso 14001 2004 environmental management system was imple mented and certified in all company facilities back in 2010 and successfully recertified in 2013 so konzum will continue to undertake its activities in this respect. a 22000 2005 food safety management system was implemented in all company stores and certified in velpro centers super konzum stores and in warehouses. konzum also had its occupational safety system certified according to ohsas 18001 2007 and its in formation security system according to iso iec 27001 2013. the objectives of the environmental management sys tem in 2014 and 2015 were to train drivers for eco driving im plement new technological solutions and achieve savings by using nonrenewable energy sources. savings were achieved by regularly maintaining equipment reconstructions heat ing system installation of led lighting and motion sensors and training the employees. the heating plants in four stores were reconstructed and heating oil was replaced by more ener gy efficient and less harmful natural gas in four stores. in 57 stores the existing exterior lighting was replaced by led bulbs t8 fluorescent tubes were replaced by more energy effi cient t5 tubes and motion sensors were installed in the least used areas. motion sensors were installed in the garages of six super konzum stores and led bulbs replaced the former light ing at the fruits vegetables departments in 18 stores. train ing of freight vehicle drivers resulted in reduced co emis sions generated by cargo vehicles. between may and novem ber of 2014 215 cargo vehicle drivers attended an eco driving course held by oryx group in five cities zagreb osijek ri thanks to the integration of the iso 14001 and haccp documentation and its availability in electronic format on the intranet portal the volume of printed documents was reduced and less paper waste is now generated. according to the target set and the relevant statutory requirements r 22 was com pletely phased out in all equipment. we did not fully achieve our objective of implementing an energy efficient manage ment system because the legal framework is vague not all necessary regulations were put in place so the attainment of this objective was transferred to the next period. in 2015 we began to prepare for the implementation of an energy efficiency system according to the requirements of 50001. the implementation and certification of this system are scheduled for late 2016. in late 2015 a new ordinance was put in place that defines the possibility of donating food where by konzum became even more actively involved in cooperation with the local community in addition to the primary goal of helping people with lower income this should also help reduce the amount of retired assets. in addition to their intensified ac tivities regarding food donation konzum continues to partici pate in the campaign for collecting plastic bottle caps for the croatian leukemia and lymphoma patients association. one of the most important future objectives is to fully computerize the flow of all types of waste on all levels which is why we expect to improve our control of the entire waste management system. in late 2015 the former mercator p 3200 store on rad ferent than the other stores the fresh product departments were improved and new services were offered for example the juice bar the coffee corner in the winter garden. etc. . a prize contest was organized for the opening ceremony at the rede tesla electric car whereby we made it clear to our customers that we are an environmentally conscious company promot ing the use of alternative energy sources. the store s parking lot features the first konzum electric vehicle charging station representing an important service now available to environ mentally aware citizens who will surely appreciate this. 10 more charging station are planned to be installed in 2016 in parking lots or garages of konzum stores. a new web shop konzum klik was opened in late 2015 in the former getro vrbani building in zagreb. in addition

emissions as a re sult of switching to more environmentally acceptable fuel. we plan to install autogas systems in around 150 cargo vehicles and expect to thereby reduce our fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. we will also continue to provide training to our freight vehicle drivers to achieve even greater reductions. in the context of waste management we plan to implement a fully computerized system for monitoring the flow of all types of waste in all facilities. this will facilitate document preparation on the store level however the greatest benefit provided will be full control at all stores at all times which will allow for better results with respect to the organization of sorting and transport of waste from each site. we also plan to intensify our activities regarding food donations which should have a social effect of helping citizens with low income and result in better discard planning in stores i. e. reduction of class 3 waste. we will continue with our cam paign for collecting bottle caps to help leukemia patients but it will be extended to additional sites. we are also planning to conduct marketing campaigns to mark environment relevant dates environment day etc. to make konzum a prominent leader in the area of environmental protection as well. the management systems implemented and certified during the preceding period will continue to be maintained and im proved. an iso 14001 recertification is scheduled for may june of 2016. surveillance audits to be conducted by the iso 22000 certifier are planned in two phases in february and july

activity to be highlighted in this reporting period is the acquisition of 90 mercator retail stores in late 2014 which significantly reinforced the net work in the context of size and market position. in 2014 a natural disaster occurred in bosnia and her zegovina a flood that destroyed three retail stores along was completely destroyed while the other two suffered sub stantial damage. all destroyed stores were fully reconstruct ed. all products affected by the flood and all waste resulting from the renovation were disposed of in an environmentally acceptable manner. a post flood inspection found no emis sions of dangerous substances. this reporting period was marked by preparations for alignment with the legislative requirements in the area of chemicals management a database of the chemicals we use in our business was created and the relevant documents were verified for compliance with the relevant statutory re quirements. according to the targets set for this reporting period preventive surveillance was established over the discharge of refrigerant from equipment in maxi and super stores within the retail network and all velpro centers. we trained 306 employees on the requirements of the environmental management system. we also installed 14 grease traps for separating waste grease and oil. in 2014 we worked on preparing a technical and techno logical project for a banana ripening plant. this implied designing the layout for all rooms and arranging the pallet spaces in the ripening facility. an environmental impact assessment was made and a proposal was submitted for the management of all management aspects. these aspects per tain to potential emissions of refrigerant and ethylene gas hazardous and nonhazardous types of waste to be generated paper plastic fluorescent bulbs ee waste wood and bio waste and wastewater discharge. in 2015 we successfully had our iso 14001 environ mental management system recertified. according to the tar gets set for the preceding period we installed a heat recovery system and a var compensator. led lighting was installed in 20 retail stores and containers were made available for vol untary disposal of ee waste in 10 retail stores. useful waste selection paper nylon bottle caps was launched in the ad ministration building. the forklift trucks are equipped with sound and light signals as an occupational safety measure and office areas were equipped with certified power cables. for the purposes of presenting the environmental indi cators the information about the input and output categories pertain to the entire system including the retail and whole sale networks and the administration building. it should be noted that most of the indicators in 2015 were higher as a re sult of the sales network enlargement in late

rapid growth of the sales network in late 2014 when an increase occurred due to the initial stocking of standard assortment. in february of 2014 a regulation came into force that defines payment of charges for disposable bags based on their thickness and prohibits purchasing of disposable shop ping bags thicker than 20 m because all disposable bags exceeding this figure are considered to be

replacement of meters installation of reactive power compensators and an integrated meter and transport route optimization are the measures undertaken on an ongo ing basis for the purpose of reducing costs and consumption of fuel of all forms and sources. the tariff model change i. e. switching to a model where power is not measured to a model with power mea surement provides financial savings of around 10 for facil ities using a total of 10 000 kwh of active power per month. the meter replacement also results in financial savings be tween 10 and 20. the installation of compensators is an investment with a payback period of 12 15 months. it provides financial sav ings because it eliminates reactive power by 2 3 but also extends the equipment lifetime. the installation of an inte grated

natural setting. the company adheres to sustainable commerce principles and endeavors to make its activities sustainable and environmentally harmless on a daily basis while encouraging its suppliers to engage in sustainable production and its customers to practice sustain able consumption. the management of environmental aspects in mercator has been systematically defined since 2009 and confirmed by a cer tificate for its established environmental management system according to iso 14001 2004. for the purpose of effectively managing the environmental as pects we assessed the environmental risks. the greatest envi ronmental risk we identified for 2015 was the risk in the area of electricity heating and waste management. the only identified critical risk was the risk associated with less efficient consump tion of electricity due to sub optimally designed business pro cessed and installed technologies. this is the first time mercator provides its sustainable develop ment report according to the gri guidelines as part of agrokor group. in 2014 and 2015 the environmental management system was developed by undertaking the following crucial activities for the purpose of reducing costs and optimization in the area of packaging waste management in early 2014 the com pany joined the unirec collective packaging waste scheme. for the purpose of efficiently managing over 10 000 tons of packaging waste generated by mercator every year 25 sta tionary screw presses of 32 m were installed in distribution centers and at retail sites. these presses are able to reduce the volume of packaging up to 10 times thus also reducing the frequency of packaging waste transport. using revised internal documents our employees were trained for proper packaging waste sorting for the purpose of complying with our mid term plan for reducing mixed municipal waste by 10 206 retail stores optimized the volume of their mixed municipal waste con tainers installed containers for small packaging waste and bio waste and thus increased the share of sorted waste and reduced the cost of mixed municipal waste disposal 23 renovated retail stores installed separate waste baskets for customers

slovenia. in 2015 the company used 1 333 490 gj of energy which is a 6 increase compared to 2014. the reason for such increase is assumed to be an error in entering data about heating and heating lpg consumption in the sap mm applica tion. gasoline consumption decreased by 25 as a result of outsourcing some of the maintenance services which in turn resulted in less business trips. natural gas consump tion decreased by 10 as a result of a project for producing heat and electricity through a system of 25 cogenerations. remote heating consumption a method of heating build ings where heat is transmitted to the consumer from a large source of heat via a pipeline the heat transmission medium is normally water or steam the heat source is a boiler or a central heating plant was specified as being 71. 3 higher compared to 2014 however this is a result of an error in en tering consumption data in the sap mm application due to a lower average temperature in 2015 and implementation of new cogenerations which in turn resulted in lower natural gas consumption and higher remote heating consumption due to a defective meter calorimeter at mercator center ljubljana. consumption of lpg that powers forklift trucks increased as a result of redirecting the distribution of fresh products from dc zalog to dc maribor and dc ptuj which have no loading ramps so products are loaded and unloaded using forklift trucks. in 2015 consumption of other ener gies according to the activities undertaken and described in other indicators decreased compared to 2014 i. e. remained comparable. it was

information is available for the preceding reporting period prior to the conditionally allowed concentration about greenhouse gas emissions for mercator s sites. mercator s did not have its own fleet at the time so it is impossible to compare data for the two periods. en20 emissions of ozone depleting substances ods mercator s stores do not use r 12 as refrigerant in their refrigerated display

compared to 312. 60 kg in the preceding reporting period. this reduction in the share of r 22 is a result of disinvesting old facilities and ren ovations where old installations were replaced by new ones using r 404a. mercator s 72en22 total water discharge by quality and destination the total amount of wastewater withdrawn from 10 septic tanks in 2014 was 94 836 m compared to 4139 m from six

city sewerage system and closing our facilities us ing septic tanks. wastewater quality is tested in 35 business facilities three times a year. tests showed a number of noncompliant analyses performed during the period following the condi tionally allowed concentration so the drainage pipes and grease separators were rewashed and the wastewater was retested. this large number of noncompliant analyses is a result of the fact that some of the separators and their drain age pipes had not been adequately maintained for an extend ed period of time and contained a large amount of deposited grease that was gradually washed out. no noncompliant anal yses were found in the last quarter of 2015. en23 total weight of waste by type and disposal method waste by type 2014 2015 paper packaging

report ing period. this increase in the amount of hazardous waste collected is a result of cleaning two plants in subotica and tionally allowed concentration. in 2014 around 80 tons of oiled mixture was disposed of from a total of 17 separators that are cleaned three or four times a year classified as nonhazardous waste. in 2015 2320 m of nonhazardous waste was withdrawn from a total of 36

goods. as a result of our ongoing development of our own retail net work we have set new trends on the market and have supple mented the distinctive offerings of tisak with new attractive products and services designed for modern customers. in ad dition to their wide product range tisak newsstands also offer many unique and innovative services at over 1 300 retail units across croatia. in 2014 and 2015 tisak continuously worked on devel oping new services such as money transfer parking payment and bus ticket sale but also further improved its existing ser vices such as delivering parcels to newsstands and interna tional shipping. tisak also continued to sell commercial goods supplied by local suppliers and toys for which tisak is an ex clusive agent which it distributes to other customers retail units in addition to its own retail units which makes tisak unique in this area. as of 2013 tisak has purchased old paper from individ uals at purchasing stations across croatia. in 2015 they start ed to purchase textile from individuals. at the end of the re porting period tisak had a total of 33 purchasing stations on the territory of the republic of croatia. tisak purchases dai ly newspapers leaflets magazines catalogs office paper and textile. after collection paper is treated pressed and baled and then sold in the open market to companies engaging in paper processing. this activity provides multiple social bene fits by reducing the amount of landfilled waste enabling the use of waste as a raw material for the production of new pa per and by raising environmental awareness among citizens. in 2014 and 2015 tisak purchased 30 more nonhazardous waste than in 2013. to maximize its scope tisak provided old paper collection boxes in all its offices which paper is then sent for recycling. these boxes are also available in the admin istration buildings of other agrokor group members and tisak collects and disposes of that old paper as well. in this reporting period tisak continued to conduct its plastic bottle caps for expensive medicines campaign or ganized by the croatian leukemia and lymphoma patients association. the project aims to use the money raised by bot tle cap recycling to purchase expensive medicines for patients association members but also to encourage our employees to avoid throwing away plastic pet packaging caps. tisak collects

to 2013. the absence of alumi num cans in 2014 and 2015 compared to 2013 is a result of changes in product packaging we now use polymeric mate rials while the reduction in incoming pallets is a result of reduced amounts of goods received from european suppliers. the total increase in the amount of paper cardboard pack aging and other polymeric materials is a result of increased container imports.

distribution routes following an increase in the distribution of newspaper subscriptions and parcels as well as enlargement of tisak s fleet. the decrease in natural gas con sumption compared to the preceding reporting period is a result of heating optimization in the administration building and the logistic distribution center in zagreb as well as a decrease in the surface area of the warehouses

year. the increase is a result of reduced total turnover and somewhat higher energy consumption. en6 reduction of energy consumption in 2014 tisak began to control the management of its air conditioning systems and to control its use of electricity in its business premises. such controls resulted in the purchase of air conditioners of higher energy standards and replace ment of standard lighting fixtures by energy efficient light bulbs or led lighting. the decrease in natural gas consump tion compared to the preceding reporting period is a result of controlling central system management and consumption rationalization as well as controlling its use by end users. the calculation was made based on the consumption rates recorded for larger facilities using data obtained by internal measurements and information provided by suppliers for the respective reporting years. water en8 total water withdrawal by source retail units account for most of the consumption in tisak if

mayonnaise based dressings in croatia having a tradition of almost a hundred years. in 1993 zvijezda became part of agrokor group. by continuously in vesting in production product safety and customer satisfac tion zvijezda provides its customers with high quality safe and nutritionally balanced standardized products. production includes processing raw sunflower rape and soybeans and making margarine mayonnaise and mayonnaise based deli cacies. our longstanding experience in producing high quali ty products meeting the market requirements allows us to de velop new products based on health nutritional and environ mental trends to provide our customers with full satisfaction and value for money and to extend the range of our products available on the market. zagreb. zvijezda s production facility comprises three basic units oil refining plant oil bottling plant and margarine and delicacy production plant. in 2014 distribution and storage of zvijezda products were outsourced to pik vrbovec for the purpose of rationalizing our costs by using the synergic effects within agrokor group. pik vrbovec took over the entire fleet including all trucks 77 trucks of different load capacities and forklift trucks 31 elec tric and gas forklift trucks. all zvijezda s and pik vrbovec s products are distributed together to our distribution centers in osijek rijeka and split and to our major customers retail chains central warehouses. this reduced the amount of fuel used for our vehicles in our balance sheet which was much higher in earlier years. we now only present the amount of fuel used by our company cars. accordingly we reduced the amount of greenhouse gas emissions denominated in tons of co. environmental protection is one of the key targets in zvijezda and is practiced by adhering to the principles of sus tainable development and cleaner production as well as by preventing any environmental pollution at all times. our sys tematic monitoring of environmental risks and impacts al lowed us to define the aspects that have or may have environ mental impacts which now represent a base for environmen tal management by defining the targets and meeting them by conducting programs. our quality environmental and food safety manage ment system certificates demonstrate our compliance with iso 9001 iso 14001 and haccp as well as the codex alimen tarius. in addition zvijezda holds a kosher certificate for its products and had its information security management sys tem certified according to iso 27001 2011. all these systems were recertified in late 2015. as required by retail chains we also implemented ifs food a food safety management sys tem thus increasing the level of safety for zvijezda products. in 2015 we completed the implementation of our energy efficiency management system according to iso 50001 2011 and had it certified. this reinforced the environmental protec tion position at zvijezda and we also complied with the statu tory requirement of conducting energy audits or implement ing energy efficiency management systems at major organiza tions. in late 2014 the energy efficiency act official gazette 127 14 was promulgated which defines the requirements of conducting energy audits at major organizations. the quality and environmental protection targets set for the 2014 reporting period were attained. we put into service a new steam boiler at the heating plant installed in late 2013 after the burner parameters were ad justed the results became noticeable in 2014. our reduction of emissions is proportional to our reduction of energy con sumption natural gas and using a new combined burner. this combined burner natural gas heating oil allows us to switch between these two energy forms in risky situations when natural gas supply is disrupted in particular during the winter months. a training project titled eco driving was conducted and co funded in cooperation with the environmental protec tion and energy efficiency fund. we trained 20 freight ve hicle drivers who will be able to significantly reduce our fuel consumption and co emissions by changing their driving style. we also successfully completed our pallet management and monitoring target achieving savings in excess of 30. most of the targets set for 2015 were attained except for major investments such as the margarine plant modernization projects which will be completed in 2016. we attained the following targets we implemented iso 50001 energy efficiency manage ment we built a waste container dock outside the margarine plant we built an awning to cover pallets and waste margarine in barrels we replaced r 22 by an environmentally acceptable refrig erant for the air conditioning system in the administration building. we are very much focused on improving our technolog ical processes and training our employees in particular with respect to environmental matters. our management systems are improved and upgraded on an ongoing basis. zvijezda 86materials en1 materials used by weight or volume materials used include raw materials associated process materials and materials for packaging purposes used in the production of primary products. all materials our supplied by external suppliers. these figures show that the total amounts of materials used in 2015 were reduced compared to 2014. this is a result of a decrease in total production which is in line with the trend recorded during the preceding reporting period where the amount of materials used decreased by around 10 com pared to this reporting

we use superheated steam for heating pipelines and tanks that heat operating areas intend ed for production and storage of finished products. the entire steam generation process takes place at the heating plant and steam is used wherever necessary. the form of energy used in the heating plant to make steam is natural gas which is mostly used for the deodorization phase in the raw oil refin ing plant. in 2013 we installed a new boiler having a capacity 10 t h lower than the previously used one which resulted in noticeable reduction of gas consumption in 2014. our reduc tion of emissions is directly proportional to our reduction of energy consumption natural gas. electricity is mostly used to power machines lines and pumps mainly in the margarine and delicacy produc tion plant. some of the electricity is used for cooling the raw materials and finished products warehouses. our electricity consumption depends on the season and is greater during the summer months than during the winter months due to the seasonal nature of production. a significant decrease was also recorded in transport fuel consumption because pik vrbovec transported zvijezda s products in this reporting period. reductions were recorded for other energy forms as well however not so substantial. en5 energy intensity energy intensity is presented as consumption of electricity and gas per product unit. energy

and rational use of energy. in late 2014 we began to implement our energy efficiency management system. our energy efficiency man agement system was successfully certified in november of 2015. during the implementation of the energy efficiency management system an energy audit was conducted at zvi jezda large energy consuming devices were identified and a reference base was set which is used to prepare measures to improve energy efficiency and energy efficiency indicators. en8 total water withdrawal by source zvijezda uses water from two sources the public water supply system and its own onsite well for which it holds a concession. water is used as part of products for cooling for wash ing plants and plant lines as sanitary water and for drinking. water is also used to make steam at the heating plant. like any other food industry zvijezda uses large amounts of water for washing to comply with hygienic standards and ensure product safety. our water is under constant control of our own laboratory and external licensed laboratories as re quired by the relevant regulations. total water withdrawal by source m 3 year process water well water public water supply system total volume

standards regularly maintaining our pipelines and quickly intervening in case of an accident the amounts of water used consumed are constantly decreasing as shown by the figures concerning the amounts of water used. com pared to the preceding reporting period we reduced our total consumption of water public and well water. part of this reduction is associated with the reduction in production and part is a result of improved utilization of condensate recov ery repair of leaks on the public and well water pipelines and training our employees for the rational use of water plant washing timely closing of any water sources faucets etc. . en9 water sources significantly affected by withdrawal of water zvijezda systematically monitors and rationalizes its water consumption recirculation was performed in earlier peri ods whenever possible. when we purchase new lines and technologies they practically already contain closed water systems new refinery which reduces our water consump tion to a sustainable level. we have water meters in place and constantly monitor our consumption which allows us to detect any illogical consumption caused by ruptures and to repair them immediately. we regularly inspect and maintain our pipelines. en10 percentage and total volume of water recycled and reused the water used in the heating plant to make steam and for production purposes is recirculated condensate accounting for 25 and 30. the same amount of condensate was re circulated during the preceding reporting period however as mentioned above we utilized the condensate optimally which resulted in reduced water consumption. we continue to examine the options of using recirculating condensate in other process locations. zvijezda 88emissions effluents and waste en15 direct

cooling towers. the consumption of water and other forms of energy has been systematically monitored in zvijezda since 2001 and strategic water reduction tasks were set based on such data. wherever possible the plants worked on water recir culation procedures as a measure to reduce the total amount of water used. production on production lines is planned by allowing for making products one by one without washing the line or maximizing the size of each batch. this resulted in water savings without affecting the safety of our products. all wastewater is treated by a wastewater treatment

modernizing our lighting and its operating mode within the margarine and delicacies depart ment led lighting. zvijezda 92dijamant a. d. i s an oil vegetable fat margarine and may onnaise industry headquartered in zrenjanin. dijamant has operated within agrokor group since 2005 and is one of the largest oleaginous plant processors and vegeta ble fat producers in this part of southeast europe. the report shows data for 2014 and 2015. the indicators prepared demon strate dijamant s focus on environmental protection. it is re flected in reduced pollution proper waste management direct investments in equipment and processes generating less noise and designed to prevent any leaks etc. in 2014 dijamant successfully had its existing stan dards iso 9001 2008 iso14001 2004 gmp fssc22000 haccp and halal recertified and added kosher to the list of certified standards. as regards its targets set in the preceding reporting pe riod dijamant attained as follows in 2014 we put into service our wastewater pumping station which allows for precise measuring of wastewater dis charge and adjusting the discharge mode we started to separate polypropylene packaging waste from municipal waste during this reporting period we sep arated five tons of waste polypropylene and delivered it to li censed collecting organizations the chemicals we purchase and use are reported and registered in the chemicals registry. msds master safety data sheets are updated on an annual basis and solid and liq uid chemicals are particularly monitored. we also maintain records of the circulation of chemicals and biocides. chemi cals are supplied in reusable packaging for this reporting period we plan to precisely deter mine our consumption of electricity as an environmental indi cator for each production process chemical water preparation oil extraction compressor operation etc. . we are still work ing on this environmental indicator because we have not yet provided for the measurement of all parameters for each pro duction line. in other words some parameters are still mea sured on a plant basis and then calculated for each product and process electricity consumption water consumption. we managed to reduce the amount of our municipal waste by increasing the share of secondary raw materials extracted from it improving our management or our working processes less wasting introducing reusable packaging for raw mate rials etc. this resulted in a decrease by 21 compared to the preceding reporting period we conducted an internal employee training about the importance of waste sorting as a prerequisite for efficient dis posal. we regularly inspect the factory area and instruct our employees on how to handle waste. in 2014 we launched reg ular meetings with individuals residing near the factory for the purpose of obtaining feedback on the performance of di jamant s environmental management policy. this primarily concerns the control of noise unpleasant odors and dust emis sions although we planned to we did not plant trees or under take any activities regarding the excessive noise and dust in dijamant s plants. this includes facilities not located in zren janin for which dijamant is responsible as the owner or les in 2015 we had our existing standards successfully re certified. in addition the halal food standard was extended to all products made by dijamant a. d. we implemented ko sher as a new standard. kosher only applies to fats and oils made in dijamant. this decision was made because techno logically only this product group is made under conditions re quired by kosher. no iso 18001 training was held and for the purpose of obtaining a water management li cense in 2015 we created a document titled water manage ment requirements as the first document to be used to com plete that task. a decision was made to establish a team that will prepare an action plan to resolve our wastewater issues in 2016. unlike the 2015 plan we did not work on obtaining an

e. from nonrenewable sources. a product unit is the total amount of production in tons. in this reporting period the total energy intensity de creased by 30 compared to the preceding reporting peri od. our electricity consumption in 2015 increased by 12 in 2015 compared to 2014 as a result of increased turnover of commercial seed in our silos. our consumption of natural gas decreased by 8 in 2015 as a result of an increased scope of sunflower processing which generates shell as a form of ener gy much cheaper than natural gas. considering that the amount of goods produced and the structure of products varied during the reporting period it may be concluded based on the energy intensity recorded during this period that the total amount of energy used per product unit did not change significantly. year energy form total energy used gj total amount of products in tons energy used per unit produced gj ton 2014 electricity 92 725. 93 461 097. 17 0. 201 fuel for transport 31 231. 15

were installed and consumption levels in our plants were recorded. we check for any variations in consumption on a daily basis and regularly check samples. the organization of our production process makes the greatest contribution to electricity consumption optimization and we endeavor to maintain production conti nuity without any unnecessary interruptions or restarting because this requires substantial amounts of electricity. by practicing constant monitoring of the condition of our equipment we find any steam leaks and repair them. water en8 total water withdrawal by source year own

of grease resulting from the pro duction process. waste grease from products passes direct ly through a grease trap and is channeled to processing for animal feed production. this grease was previously incorpo rated in wastewater thus putting an additional burden on the treatment plants. on the other hand as technology developed and busi nesses for biogas production emerged the grease and grease deposits collected from wastewater now have their commer cial value which justified the additional cost of investing in treatment plant chemicals. year total water discharge m 2014 262 915 2015

decrease is primarily a result of reduced wastewater charges. all environmental management prevention invest ment and management costs remained at approximately the same level. the differences in monetary values are a result of different amounts of environmental parameter monitoring costs. compared to 2014 in 2015 the cost of waste treatment and disposal was slightly higher as a result of the structure of waste and disposal costs. pursuant to the waste manage ment act we outsourced our organic waste disposal activi ties as of 2015 which primarily relates to expired products. in 2015 we disposed of 8. 8 tons of waste which is 21 more than in 2014. our emission treatment cost was 24 higher in 2015 than in 2014 as a result of more accurate measuring of electricity consumption for the plant and of taking into account the elec tricity used by other devices indirectly connected to the elec trostatic filter. the electrostatic filter s scope of operation in 2015 did not significantly change compared to 2014. the 66 increase recorded in this reporting period compared to the preceding reporting period is a result of installing additional electricity meters and more accurate measuring of consump tion which is why it should not be considered an increase in costs but rather improved allocation of air emission treat ment costs. in 2015 our cost of water from the public water supply system decreased by 5 compared to 2014 which is a direct result of increased use of water from our own wells. compared to the preceding reporting period our water costs dijamant 98decreased by 41 because we started to use more well water compared to public water in 2014. the costs of wastewater discharged into the public sewerage system during this reporting period decreased by 68 compared to the preceding reporting period due to a change in the legal status of the wastewater recipient. the institute costs are the costs of external laboratories and institutes hired to conduct mandatory measurements of en vironmental parameters. these costs increased by 12 in 2015 compared to 2014 as a result of doubling the number of emission analyses on dijamant s boilers as directly required by the relevant authorities. no substantial changes were re corded compared to the preceding reporting period. plans for 2016 dijamant set the following targets for the next reporting period continue pursuing our activities toward obtaining a water management license continue with our efforts toward obtaining an integrated license these activities are primarily related to the water man agement license which must be obtained as a condition precedent to obtaining an integrated license finalize our activities with respect to measuring environmental indicator parameters by production line. in

adar is a company transporting oleaginous plants and all kinds of cereals and storing and handling goods in silos and under floor warehouses. until 2012 sojara processed domestic or imported soybeans into soybean meal soybean oil and lecithin. the processing capacity is up to 1100 t per day. on 1 july 2014 a decision was made to un dertake no processing activities in 2014 and 2015 due to the planned investments and for the purpose of obtaining the re quired documentation for the new plant. sojara is convenient ly located near zadar port and very close to railway and road routes used for transporting and handling oleaginous plants and cereals. in addition sojara is equipped with its own trans shipment tower on a port pier which is able to receive the larg est freight ships. our silo for storing oleaginous plants cere als and flour having a capacity of 38. 000 m offers opportuni ties in the context of imports and exports of goods. sojara zadar started its production activities in 1977. in 1991 sojara d. d. became part of agrokor group thus estab lishing better cooperation with companies such as belje zvi jezda etc. in late 2013 sojara changed its legal status as a joint stock company to a limited liability company. in novem ber of 2012 sojara discontinued its processing activities. as of 2013 sojara only transports oleaginous plants and all kinds of cereals and stores and handles goods in silos and under floor warehouses. before this report was written a location permit was issued for a new heating plant and the relevant building permit is still pending. the indicators provided in the report thus only relate to transport handling and storage. sojara is particularly committed to quality control envi ronmental protection and product safety. it reduces its adverse environmental impacts by constantly training its employees and optimizing its energy and natural resource consumption. as no production activities were undertaken during the report ing period but only handling transport and storage activities sojara s environmental impacts were significantly reduced. in 2001 sojara was certified according to the iso 9001 2008 quality management standard. the most recent re certification was carried out in 2015 while surveillance audits are conducted every year. in 2010 we had our environmental management system certified according to iso 14001 2004 while surveillance audits are also carried out every year. our iso 14001 was last recertified in 2013. sojara has also imple mented an haccp system and is subject to the ippc directive and the kyoto protocol. the targets set for 2014 and 2015 were as follows improve our waste management system by providing on going training of all employees with respect to the need to sort municipal and other waste provide more containers for specific types of waste and improve our solid waste depos itory. this target was partially met. trainings are provided on an ongoing basis and we did not purchase new

for the purpose of making lasting improvements jam nica launched a project in cooperation with the environmen tal protection and energy efficiency fund intended to reduce co emissions and carbon footprint and improve energy and input efficiency. in 2014 we conducted our eco driving program focused on training drivers of trucks and company cars to change their driving styles and thus help significantly reduce our co emissions. the eco driving project included training for 20 m1 passenger transport category drivers and 30 n2 and n3 freight transport category drivers for vehicles in excess of 3. 5 tons and 12 tons respectively. all passengers successfully completed this training provided by oryx group and were is sued their eco driver certificates. we purchased five hybrid vehicles which are expected to reduce our co emissions by around 10. we implemented a transport optimizing information system which in addition to reducing our energy consump tion and pollutant emissions ensures efficiency in our daily fleet operations. in cooperation with the croatian cleaner production center and unido s consultants from austria jamnica imple mented its low carbon technologies project. low carbon is an economic system which implies producing and using basic goods with less fossil fuels. we conducted a feasibility study analyzed our production processes and our existing technolo gy measured and analyzed our energy balance sheet and pre pared a plan including an economic analysis for lc options. the project was implemented at the jamnica plant site and the report shows that in the present situation as assessed jam nica does not have plenty of room for improvements. the im provement options offered are financially unfeasible and im ply a long payback period. as part of an initiative to promote carbon footprint anal ysis and neutralization projects jamnica launched its carbon footprint project. in 2015 we implemented a pilot project to determine the carbon footprint of jamnica mineral water in 1. 5 l pet packaging and 1 l reusable glass packaging con sidering the entire product lifecycle from the production and transport of production input and production and distribution of the product to the disposal and treatment of packaging. the study included a comprehensive carbon footprint estimate taking into account all major sources of emissions throughout the product lifecycle. we identified and quantified the materials and energy forms used for the production trans port and procurement of production materials for our key sup

own steam resulting from the combustion of fuel in a closed system and make the necessary calculations based on the heating value of fuel. as a result of our production planning optimization including longer batches we reduce our fuel consumption and produce greater quantities of finished products. our mea surements of fuel consumption for production and heating purposes are not physically separated so any variations in consumption may also result from weather conditions. in its warehousing operations jamnica uses forklift trucks powered by liquefied petroleum gas lpg and environmen tally acceptable electric forklift trucks for its indoor activi ties. our consumption of lpg depends on our logistic pro cesses and finished product and material handling rates. natural gas is used at our sales storage sites pc za tion is dependent upon the weather conditions. our electricity consumption depends on the type of product juice water and the packaging used for the prod ucts. in addition we took into account our electricity con sumption at all jamnica s sites. we are supplied with electricity by hrvatska elektro privreda. en5 energy intensity energy intensity indicators are calculated in relation to the initial reference year. the reference year for jamnica d. d. was 2014 when an energy inspection was performed for the purpose of collecting all data and information relevant to our consumption and use of energy preparing status analysis and undertaking measures to improve energy properties and energy efficiency. energy intensity is presented as fuel consumption

consumption costs as crucial elements of business success. the certification of iso 50001 2011 provided a frame work for pursuing our energy policy including specific tar gets aimed to improve our energy efficiency. this standard requires efficiency to be achieved by using a systematic ap proach to energy management based on ongoing progress. we defined general and specific energy consumption indicators reviewed our critical areas and checked for places where improvements can be made to save energy and ratio nalized our use of energy and energy consumption manage ment. we set a foundation for effective planning in the con text of investments and planned expenses. the main guidelines for energy management are raise our employees awareness of the need for proper and rational energy management consider energy consumption when making decisions re garding the design and procurement of equipment materi als or services achieve measurable results in connection with energy effi ciency use and consumption and develop energy using plans allowing for more efficient planning of operational tasks and investments and finding new improvements in energy management. jamnica 108water en8

water and water from the public water supply system. as an essential resource water is managed rationally. water is sub jected to continuous quality audits and we monitor how much water is used and how. the total amount of water used in the 2012 2013 pe riod was 1 393 906 m of which 1 070 787 m was water withdrawn own sources for production and process purpos es and 323 119 m was water from the public supply system. in this reporting period we used 1 264 092 m of water of which 1 014 544 m was water withdrawn own sources for production and process purposes and 249 548 m was water from the public supply system. during this reporting period jamnica withdrew 9. 31 less water compared to the preced ing reporting period. water consumption in the production plants depends on the volume and range of products. in the jana plant varia tions in water consumption may result from greater or small er volumes of juice bottling on aseptic lines. en9 water sources significantly affected by withdrawal of water as one of the largest producers of mineral water and soft drinks jamnica withdraws water from the water supply sys tem for its operations. the government of the republic of croatia ministry of regional development forestry and water management granted jamnica a concession for withdrawing mineral water to be marketed and used to make other beverages at the jam water to be marketed and used to make other beverages at the svetojanske toplice site. to prevent excessive withdrawal or potential contami nation of sources jamnica identifies describes and assesses its environmental impacts and determines the possible direct and indirect impacts of projects on water soil air flora and fauna geological heritage landscape noise traffic and peo ple considering their interrelations. we use a defined environmental monitoring program to continuously monitor all our impacts associated with our water withdrawal. we introduced a telemetric module to monitor our water storage facility and collect information about the level of water therein. we use water meters to reg ister all amounts of water withdrawn and we continuously monitor collect check and measure the required physical values to fully protect our water sources against excessive withdrawal. emissions effluents and waste en15 direct greenhouse gas ghg emissions scope 1 jamnica s direct greenhouse gas emissions generated by its production plants include emissions from stationary sources. to calculate our greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources heating plants we engaged a licensed firm to make direct measurements of our emissions for 2014. our total direct co emissions by weight relate to our production and transport of materials and products and were calculated on the basis of an estimate of our co combus tion emissions as defined in appendix a air emissions to the environmental pollution registry maintenance manual. measurements of total direct co emissions are performed once in two years for our production plants and for the za greb site by a licensed organization and these values are not calculated in the year of measurement. direct greenhouse gas emissions t cde 2014

greenhouse gas emissions in 2014 jamnica purchased a new burner and control board for the heating plant in its production plant. because it was worn out and frequently malfunctioned the old burner caused incomplete fuel combustion and soot generation in the boiler. after replacing the burner in 2015 we achieved a higher degree of fuel combustion which also helped reduce out greenhouse gas emissions. as a result of converting to a new bottle design with lower preform weight and short neck design we reduced the impact of our production activities on the environment as a result of greenhouse gas emissions expressed in carbon dioxide units. the completion of this project represents a huge step forward in complying with the european trends in making carbonneutral products demonstrating an initia tive to minimize the carbon footprint throughout a product s lifecycle. en20 emissions of ozone depleting substances ods in may of 2015 we installed a new chiller on line l6

compared to 651 354 m in 2012 2013 the destination being either a class 2 water recipient or a public sewerage system depending on the location. the total amount of wastewa ter discharged during the reporting period was reduced as a result of savings achieved in the cip washing process plant disinfection savings achieved in the bottle rinsing reusable bottle washing and plant washing processes. en23 total weight of waste by type and disposal method jamnica endeavors to manage waste in an environmentally acceptable and economical manner. considering the legisla tive developments in 2014 and 2015 jamnica defined a sys tem to define measures for preventing or reducing adverse impacts of waste on human health and the environment de fined the methods and requirements for collecting and stor ing waste pending its transport and the method of disposing of waste generated at all jamnica s storage and production sites as well as the responsibilities of employees with respect to waste management. jamnica has been registered in waste management registries the registry of waste carriers and the registry of certain persons storing their own production waste. waste is sort ed at its source separately collected and temporarily stored in an area designated for temporary storage of different types of waste. our waste management and employee training ac tivities resulted in improved

carbonated predicate and archival wines and brandies. ed for primary processing ageing bottling and storage of fin ished products. in late 2013 a new line was installed in the production plant in jastrebarsko. the line includes equipment for mak ing sparkling wine using the charmat procedure equipment for making carbonated wine a wine filtering system a line for making specific types of wine and a bottle labeling plant. the juicy juice bottling plant was sold in 2014 and this ages d. o. o. aiming to improve quality and protect the environment in 2013 mladina implemented a food safety management sys tem and an environmental management system. by appointing and training a person responsible for product safety and environmental protection and performing all associated activities and by setting our targets for the next reporting period we took a further step toward responsible care for the environment monitoring all environmental as pects and eliminating and minimizing all adverse environ mental impacts. the targets set for 2014 and 2015 were partially accom plished. according to the targets set mladina redesigned its crop pro tection agent storage facility redesigned its existing premises at the jastrebarsko feeding site intended for storing fuel for working machinery tractors purchased new diesel fuel tanks including the relevant certificates volume meters and a flow meter dispenser with a fuel nozzle built a facility for its fuel tanks and trained its employees and responsible persons han dling dangerous substances. our employees handling crop protection agents pesti cides while working in vineyards during the season are reg ularly trained to prevent any noncompliance for the purpose of protecting their health providing good working conditions and establishing good agricultural practices thus protecting the environment. in early 2015 hrvatske vode issued a water manage conduct regular wastewater analyses at the site. considering the change in shareholding and control of electricity and water consumption at the juicy plant in jas trebarsko which premises are now leased by mladina we in stalled additional electricity and water meters in 2015. pursuant to article 13 of the ordinance establishing the action framework for achieving sustainable use of pes ticides which came into force on 26 november 2015 two of our employees passed the basic training examination for pro fessional users. in 2015 we purchased a new pesticide applying contain er to replace the former worn out container. this made pes ticide application more effective optimized our expenditures and prevented any unnecessary leaks. in 2014 we hired a sales employee to ensure that our new poy and selected line products assume good market po sitions be recognized by consumers and in the horeca and retail channels and to maintain the positions of our products acquired from istravino bakarska vodica and napoleon. this resulted in increased production volumes. materials en1 materials used by weight or volume our total consumption of materials includes raw materials associated process materials and materials for packaging pur poses. all these materials were supplied by external suppliers. the amount of raw material produced grapes de creased significantly compared to the 2012 2013 reporting period. one of the reasons for this is the poor 2014 season and reduced yield of old plantations. type of material used kg 2014 2015 raw materials 380 180 226 900 materials for packaging purposes 291 138 269 216 associated process materials 150 140 total 671 468

produced at this site were insignificant. abandoning 8 hectares of old vineyards in 2015 largely af fected the quantity of raw material produced. the reason for the increase in the use of packaging materials and associated process materials by over 100 compared to the preceding reporting period is increased pro duction of sparkling and carbonated wines which increased our use of ampania classic bottles of greater weight and enlargement of mladina s product range. energy en3 energy consumption within the organization our total energy consumption within the organization in the juicy plant in

billing period the calculation of total electrici ty consumption compared to the preceding reporting period includes electricity consumption in the new carbonated and sparkling wine bottling plant within the juicy site. a sep arate meter for mladina was installed at this site in 2015 which is why our consumption in 2014 was calculated based on data recorded in 2015 as the amounts of finished products made were similar. an analysis of our consumption in 2015 found errors in calculations by the lessor for certain months so the total consumption was adjusted based on consumption for the erroneously calculated months for the purpose of obtaining more accurate electricity consumption data. compared to the preceding reporting period our con sumption increased by 107 which is consistent with the increase in the production of finished products and inclusion of heating wood in the consumption calculation. en5 energy intensity energy intensity is presented as electricity and heating wood consumption per one thousand liters of finished product for mladina s entire production. year energy intensity gj liter 2014 1. 51 2015 1. 63 we found the 7. 96 increase in energy intensity in 2015 compared to 2014 to be a result of a warmer year and in creased load on cooling equipment as well as a new method of accounting for our consumption at the juicy site. the total amount of finished products made during the reporting period was 521 032 liters and our total energy consumption was 645 gj. based on these figures our energy intensity is 1. 29 gj 1000 liters. period energy intensity

our energy in tensity is 1. 56 gj 1000 liters. the increase in energy intensity recorded in the new re porting period is 20. 93 . en6 reduction of energy consumption no reduction in electricity consumption was achieved in the new reporting period. therefore mladina plans to enhance its electricity consumption controls in the next period en deavor to change employee conduct and achieve a reduction in electricity consumption by changing particular production processes. mladina 114water en8 total water withdrawal by source the figures provided in the invoices based on water meters

site in jastrebarsko which contains a new line for the production and bottling of sparkling carbonated and still wines. after we installed a water meter at the juicy site in 2015 we have been able to determine how much water mla dina s plant in the leased premises uses. a decrease in the production of still wines and an in crease in the production of sparkling and carbonated wines compared to the preceding reporting period resulted in in creased water withdrawal. more water is used in the produc tion of sparkling and carbonated wines due to wine prepara tion procedures and for maintaining and washing equipment and dishes. en9 water sources significantly affected by withdrawal of water not applicable to mladina d. d. emissions effluents and waste en15 direct greenhouse gas ghg emissions

our emissions by 50. en19 reduction of greenhouse gas emissions the decrease in greenhouse gas emissions is consistent with the decrease in diesel consumptions resulting from decreased rates of raw material transport less production areas with less tractor operations a new method of delivering certain types of production materials and improved organization of transport routes. mladina 115en20 emissions of ozone depleting substances ods for our production purposes we use 0. 26 t of r 404a refrig erant. the new refrigeration system installed together with the new production line for sparkling and carbonated wines uses 0. 0153 t of r 410a refrigerant. these refrigerants are not ozone depleting. en21 no x so x and other significant air emissions mladina does not use any heating devices boilers and is not required to measure its greenhouse gas emissions from sta tionary sources according to the applicable legislation. the juicy plant occasionally uses steam from the les sor s heating plant and the lessor measures no x so x co co emissions every two years. the last measurement was performed in 2014 and the emissions were found to be within the statutory limits. according to mladina s estimate mladina uses up to 1 of the steam generated at the site for its internal purposes. the combustion of wood does not emit any sulfuric or nitrogen compounds and does not have a significant impact on air quality. en22 total water discharge by quality and destination total water discharge is determined by an estimate. waste water is discharged into the public sewerage system.

purchase and installation of equipment for measuring heating energy was postponed for the next period and will be dealt with under the plan for the construction of a new heating plant and purchase of the relevant equipment we abandoned our sudden pollution emergency operat ing plan due to the fact that we are not legally required to prepare one in bosnia and herzegovina while other documents of similar scope and purpose which are re quired under our regulations activity plan with measures and time limits for gradual reduction of emissions and alignment with the best available techniques sarajevski kiseljak mineral water source protection study and the monitoring plan were prepared and accepted by the com petent public authorities. according to the training schedule we trained our employees in environmental protection according to iso 14001 2004 lab technicians machine operators employees of our regional distribution centers and new employees of the production logistic division. to improve out waste management system we trained all our employees of the bottling plant department the syrup plant the technical department and the process automatics maintenance de

621 708 the calculation of our use of reusable packaging materials includes only reusable packaging that was first put into cir culation during the relevant reporting period. as the weight of reusable packaging glass bottles plastic crates pallets represent the most important item among the packaging ma terials used their significant increase in 2015 also increased the total amount of materials used in 2015 compared to 2014. the total amount of materials used increased by 17. 66 com pared to the preceding reporting period. this increase is a re sult of redesigning and replacing all glass packaging present in the market in 2015 a significant increase in production volumes and product range enlargement. pthe increase in the levels of other materials used is a result of increased production volumes packaging redesign and upgrading of the existing production line with new machines. the redesign of sensation products implied converting to a sleeve label that covers the entire surface of the bottle. this resulted in increased use of plastic as a packaging ma terial heating oil and steam due to the sleeving technology that requires using a steam tunnel which consumes signifi cant amounts of steam. in this reporting period the amount of materials used per liter remained stable compared to the preceding reporting period. regarding nonrenewable materials sarajevski kiseljak

energy consumption by primary source was 17 132 gj in 2014 compared to 22 673 gj in 2015. our consumption increased by 27. 89 compared to the preceding reporting period. our fuel consumption for production plant s purpos es has constantly increased over the years and this increase was also recorded during the relevant reporting period. the increase in heating oil consumption is a result of a continu ous increase in total production volumes and upgrading of the pet line with a steam tunnel in 2015 which device uses significant amounts of steam. the equipment presently installed does not allow for separate recording of heating oil and steam amounts used for heating and as fuel. no significant variations in heating oil consumption per liter of product were recorded. although our production volumes increased significantly we invest in new production lines and optimize our plant operation to reduce or maintain the level of fuel consumption per product unit. in its warehousing operations sarajevski kiseljak uses forklift trucks powered by liquefied petroleum gas lpg and environmentally acceptable electric forklift trucks for its in door activities. our lpg consumption depends on our logistic processes and the rates of handling finished products and input. during the reporting period namely in 2015 our total consumption of gas lpg used for our forklift trucks in creased significantly due a substantial level of using forklift trucks to handle old glass packaging. the redesign and replacement of the old glass packag ing required its proper disposal. for that purpose we formed an old packaging receiving center at a nearby location owned by the company where broken glass is crushed and packed in jumbo large bags. as this was a very time consuming ac tivity that required intensive logistic support it resulted in a significant increase in lpg consumption for forklift trucks. all electricity is supplied externally. our electricity consumption depends on the type of product packaging vol ume and product category. electricity consumption gj 2014 2015 electricity 19 203 21 051 sarajevski kiseljak 119our electricity consumption in 2014 was 19 203 gj

our consumption of heating oil per one thousand liters of product has been on a slight rise which is attributed to the installation of a steam tunnel which uses significant amounts of steam and this re sults in greater consumption of fuel. en6 reduction of energy consumption for the purpose of boosting its competitiveness and maintain ing its leading market position in 2014 sarajevski kiseljak fi nalized the pet bottle redesign for line l2 for bottling mineral water and sensation juices in 1. 5 and 0. 5 l packaging which bottles now feature reduced weight and a short neck design. by managing our production process on a daily basis we aim to control the operation of our machines in order to save energy and reduce our final costs. we systematical ly monitor our energy consumption and reach conclusions on how successful our measures were on the basis of such information. by undertaking the above activities and good housekeeping measures on a daily basis we expect to reduce our consumption of plastic materials and energy thus also reducing our pollution. by switching to a new bottle design with lower preform weight sarajevski kiseljak indirectly reduces the amounts of energy used by our preform suppliers. such suppliers will use 8 10 less energy to make the same amount of preforms of lower weight 5 to 7 grams less per preform and will thus save substantial amounts of electricity used to heat such preforms. water en8 total water withdrawal by source sarajevski kiseljak uses an integrated approach to water management. water used by it includes water from own sources

used for washing equipment when switching from one product type to another. sarajevski kiseljak 120en9 water sources significantly affected by withdrawal of water as one of the largest producers of natural mineral water and soft drinks sarajevski kiseljak withdraws its water from the water supply system. to prevent excessive withdrawal or po tential pollution sarajevski kiseljak has prepared a saraje vski kiseljak mineral water source protection study. the defined environmental status monitoring program provides for ongoing monitoring of all impacts associated with water withdrawal. a special mechanism is used to collect informa tion about water levels in the water tank. we use water me ters to register the amounts of water withdrawn and monitor collect control and measure the necessary physical values to fully protect our sources against excessive withdrawal. emissions effluents and waste en15 direct greenhouse gas ghg emissions scope 1 total direct greenhouse gas

water recipient wastewater is neutralized in a three degree deposit tank. the treatment of wastewater in sarajevski kiseljak will be taken care of after the town of kiseljak builds its wastewater treat ment plant after which all wastewater will flow into such town wastewater treatment plant instead of a type 2 deposit tank. in 2014 sarajevski kiseljak d. d. obtained a water man agement license for discharging process wastewater. for that purpose and to comply with the statutory requirements we engaged the licensed organization zagrebinspekt to prepare a sarajevski kiseljak mineral water source protection study and the water supply sewerage system completion status report. all activities preceding the issuance of such water management license were successfully completed and the water management license for discharging process wastewa ter was issued on 29 may 2014. according to the regulation on the conditions of discharging wastewater into natural recipients and pub lic sewerage systems official journal of the federation of bosnia and herzegovina no. 04 12 the certified organiza tion dvokut pro of sarajevo conducted a two month analy sis of wastewater quality in 2014 and

fony di 130nova sloga d. o. o. was established in 1956. it was acquired by frikom ad of belgrade in 2009 and has been part of agrokor group since 31 december 2012. nova sloga s core activities are production of mineral water and purchasing and processing of fruits and vegetables. nova sloga presently operates two plants the mg mive la natural mineral water bottling plant located in the village processing and storing fruits and vegetables located in trste nik. the targets accomplished in this reporting period we optimized the technological process and enlarged our production capacities in the mg mivela plant. in october of 2014 nova sloga launched a new mg mivela facility cov ering 2700 m. the plant includes the relevant transport in frastructure energy extensions and a state of the art bottling plant. the investment was completed in less than a year and was preceded by reconstruction and enlargement of the natu ral source. the technological process optimizations resulted in 13 savings in electricity per liter of finished product in this reporting period. in 2015 we certified our iso 14001 system in both nova sloga plants. nova sloga thus became the 21st company within agrokor group to hold an iso 14001 certificate. the old containers were adjusted to the requirements and types of waste according to iso 14001. we conducted ongoing train ing of our employees for waste management and environmen tal protection. the targets set in the preceding reporting period but not accomplished were as follows enter into contract with a suitable provider for dispos ing of and recycling a small amount of machine oil which is one of the targets for the next 2016 2017 reporting period the reason why we did not accomplish this target in the preceding reporting period is the small amount of machine oil around 50 kg which is insufficient to justify the arrival of an opera tor licensed by the competent authority for transporting stor ing and treating hazardous waste build an artesian well within the refrigeration plant for the purpose of reducing our water costs is also among the tar gets for the next reporting period during the preceding re porting period a test was conducted on nova sloga s property and supplies of water sufficient for production at the refriger ation plant were not found. the next step is to obtain consent to dig a well from the owner of the adjacent plot where such tests found supplies of water. materials en1 materials used by weight or volume type of material used kg 2014 2015 raw materials 189 030 288 920 associated process

changes occurred in this reporting peri od compared to the preceding reporting period a 64 increase in the withdrawal of groundwater bound to the product was recorded as a result of an increased scope of production. this water is used for bottling mg mive la products. our use of water from our own well for process and sanitary purposes increased by 19 which is also a result of an increased scope of production at the mg mivele plant. our water withdrawal from the public water supply system decreased by 70 because raw material processing did not require additional water consumption. en9 water sources significantly affected by withdrawal of water nova sloga has three wells from which it withdraws water. the land owned by nova sloga is not in or adjacent to any protected areas or areas of high biodiversity value. the natural source of mg mivela water is located in the cadas of 86 meters from a source located on the edge of a forest in intact nature away from any inhabited areas. no factories or any other potential polluters are located in its immediate or greater surroundings. this is why our products and services have no significant environmental or biodiversity impacts. nova sloga does not have a concession agreement in place so it exploits mineral water pursuant to an authoriza tion issued by the ministry of mining and energy of the re public of serbia which authorizes it to withdraw 4. 5 l of min eral water s and 2. 5 l of process water s. in 2015 nova sloga withdrew 28 mineral water and 4 process water. en10 percentage and total volume of water recycled and reused water used at nova sloga is presently not recycled and not used as recycled water. emissions effluents and waste en15 direct greenhouse gas ghg emissions scope 1 nova sloga presently does not use a heating plant. it retains the services of other companies for transporting its raw ma terials production materials and members of the workforce. the other production processes at nova sloga do not result in any emissions of carbon dioxide co methane ch nitro gen dioxide n2o or steam h2o and thus create no green house gases. nova sloga uses co as input for producing mg mivela carbonated mineral water. liquid co is stored in a tank i. e. a closed system. nova sloga 133en18 greenhouse gas ghg emissions intensity nova sloga s scope of business does not require measurement of greenhouse gases. the regulation defining this area is the air quality monitoring conditions and requirements regu lation official journal of rs no. 11 10 75 10 and 63 13. en19 reduction of greenhouse gas emissions the nature of nova sloga s production processes ensures that they result in no emissions of carbon dioxide co methane ch nitrogen dioxide n o or steam h o and thus create no greenhouse gases. en20 emissions of ozone depleting substances ods the refrigeration system of the mg mivela plant uses anti freeze based on nutritive monopropylene glycol which circu lates within the system and does not evaporate and thus end up in the atmosphere. in 2015 the system was replenished with 200 kg of refrigerating fluid. the refrigeration plant uses ammonia as refrigerant in its primary refrigeration system which is closed. the tanks and pipelines contain 16 t of ammonia. during the reporting period the system was replenished with 2. 49 t in 2014 and 1. 5 t in 2015. the amount of refrigeration system replenishment increased in 2014 by 40 compared to the preceding reporting period as a result of losses incurred at the time of releasing replacing oil from a screw compressor. the amount of system replenishment in 2015 is consistent with the amount recorded in the preceding reporting period. en21 no x so x and other significant air emissions nova sloga s production plant does not use any

product plant continued to be directed to a deposit tank along with surplus mineral water from bottling operations and rainwater. this way the process water in the deposit tank is diluted and neutralized and then discharged into the local watercourse. water discharged from the deposit tank meets all quality standards as confirmed by analyses conducted by the institute of public health four times per year. sanitary water is discharged into a septic tank evac uated by the public utility company of the municipality of trstenik. the refrigeration plant discharges its water into the municipal sewerage system and such water is then treat ed at the town utility company. the kraljevo institute of public health measures the quantities of wastewater discharge and issues a certified doc ument confirming the quantities measures based on which a quarterly report is submitted to the public water manage ment company the ministry of environmental protection and the environmental protection agency about the quanti ties of wastewater discharge. in this reporting period our total water discharge de creased by 47 compared to the preceding reporting period. these decrease in water discharge recorded in this reporting period is a result of optimizing our production plant washing and maintenance processes. during the preceding report ing period we purchased a new device for floor cleaning and washing at the mg mivela production plant which substan tially helped us reduce our water consumption. increased in flow of fruits and vegetables to be processed which requires no additional water consumption also helps reduce our wastewater discharge. nova sloga 134en23 total weight of waste by type and disposal method type of waste treatment 2014 t 2015 t nonhazardous waste

a screw compressor. nova sloga was particular ly alert to hazardous waste in the process of establishing its environmental management system. for proper management purposes hazardous waste is sorted at its source. a person responsible for managing hazardous waste was appointed and a waste catalog is maintained. we defined the types and the number of assets needed for disposal of hazardous waste

refrigeration plant 7 employees of the maintenance division 10 employees in the mg mivela plant and seasonal workers in both plants as necessary in 2016 we plan to prepare the necessary documents for and implement the iso 9001 2015 system and have it certified we intend to enter into contact with an eligible provider for disposing of and recycling a small amount of used up toner which is disposed of in a container intended for used up toner until such time we find a suitable operator complete the gas bottle storage facility at the mg mivela plant by 11 april 2016. this is one of the general targets that we began to accomplish in 2015 by preparing a study for the purpose of obtaining consent to the location of our lpg ware house. this target relates to the reduction of our adverse environmental impacts according to the environmental manage ment system indicators regulatory compliance and transport of products and services we plan to launch a project for converting to led lighting in both nova sloga s plants which would result in reduction of electricity consumption and we also plan to dig an artesian well for fruit vegetable processing plant s purposes which would reduce the amount of process water purchased from the public utility company for refrigeration plant s purposes. 136pik vrbovec mesna industrija d. d. i s a joint stock cor poration engaging in the

and 378 in other departments. the greatest increase in the number of employees compared to the preceding reporting period was recorded in logistics by as much as 63 as a re sult of enlarging our facilities. in april of 2014 we discontinued our production of cans. our piketa and classic brands were sold to danica which had manufactured them for pik on a private label basis. the increasing production trend continued in this reporting period in 2015 our production increased by 9. 7 at our central site in vrbovec compared to 2013. the most important accomplishments with respect to environmental management during the reporting period in clude wastewater waste and ozone layer protection as follows in early 2014 pik received its integrated environmen tal requirements for its existing pik vrbovec mi. i. d. d. plant at the vrbovec site a so called environmental permit. con sidering the fact that the most important requirement under the environmental permit was not met by the end of 2014 build our own wastewater treatment plant because of our intentions to attempt obtaining co funding for its construc tion from the european union in early 2015 pik notified the planned change in the plant s operation and extension of the time limit for wtp construction to the ministry of environ mental and nature protection menp through an authorized organization croatian cleaner production center. a decree amending the environmental permit was issued and pub lished on menp s website on 5 october 2015 whereby the time limit for wtp was extended to 31 october 2015. the works on wastewater treatment plant construction and recon struction of a part of the internal sewerage system began in april of 2015 and were completed in october of 2015. the for mer two inspection shafts kmo1 i kmo2 in the south part of the site where process wastewater is only mechanically treat ed by grease traps and discharged into the public sewerage system was replaced by a single new inspection shaft located next to the southeast fence of the site where wastewater runs through a physical chemical biological treatment plant and is discharged into a natural recipient the luka watercourse. during this and the preceding reporting period we en deavored to increase the efficiency of separate collection of reusable waste paper cardboard plastic wood glass by in tensifying our monitoring activities providing trainings and conducting internal audits to minimize our amounts of land filled municipal waste. in march of 2015 pik s environmental protection department took over two employees of a licensed waste collecting organization eko flor plus d. o. o. who prepare nonhazardous waste to be carried away from our non hazardous waste storage facility. in april of 2015 we termi nated our business cooperation with all our former nonhaz ardous waste collecting organizations for the purpose of sim plifying our management of all types of waste through a new company within agrokor e kolektor acting in the capacity of a carrier or collector or only for waste management interme diation and improvement transport optimization and stron ger connection of companies within the group. in the same month we changed our method of disposing of slaughter house waste i. e. animal byproducts class 3 materials so that such waste is now fired from a pneumatic gun into agropro teinka s container instead of dumping it from a dumping cart using a dumping crane into the relevant container for class 3 ems target for 2015. in 2015 we obtained a certificate of registration in the registry of persons storing their own production waste from menp for our hazardous waste storage facility at the vr bovec site class 351 01 15 01 367 ref. 517 06 3 1 2 15 2 waste producer storage facility

devices containing more than 3 kg of ozone de pleting refrigerant. that same year showed a continued up ward trend in production and a downward trend in natural gas consumption including the greenhouse gas emissions result ing from the heating plant and in the amount of packaging used. we successfully reduced our electricity and water con sumption despite increased production and use of dangerous cleaning products and disinfectants. we particularly reduced our use of chlorine based disinfectants and replaced them by products less adverse for the environment. in april of 2015 a scheduled official audit was conduct ed during which nonconformities were found in relation to the relevant authorizations in the area of wastewater and vet erinary requirements these nonconformities were rectified in 2015 and the following report was published on menp s website http www. mzoip. evolare. host25. com doc provedba planiranih koordiniranih nadzora u i tromjesecju 2015 godine. pdf. in april of 2015 surveillance audits of iso 9001 i 14001 were conducted at the vrbovec site and in pc rijeka. an iso 50001 pre audit was conducted in late october of 2015 and a certification audit was successfully completed in december of 2015. in late 2015 pik implemented its energy management system iso 50001. the following targets were accomplished during the re porting period in 2014 we improved our waste management system by reducing the amount of municipal waste per ton of product by 2. 27 we reduced our water consumption for the process packaging washing machine by 2 as set by install ing injectors for the stainless steel version which ensure con stant water consumption and by installing thermodynamic probes which maintain the temperature of water in the tank at pik vrbovec 138pik vrbovec a constant level we repaired our air duct installations where they leaked we reconstructed the low and medium voltage transformer stations for the purpose of ensuring more effec tive supply of the plant with electricity and installed meters to improve or electricity consumption monitoring and save electricity in the future. that same year we removed r22 from the remaining refrigeration devices and replaced it by r 404 which is not ozone depleting and trained our drivers for eco driving to achieve potential fuel savings in the future pe riod. in 2015 we installed water meters at the slaughterhouse the processing plant and the heating station for the purpose of monitoring our actual water consumption. materials en1 materials used by weight or volume pik vrbovec does

trans porting goods within and outside the vrbovec site and for our company cars and propane butane fuel powering our forklift trucks and pig singeing furnaces in the slaughterhouse in absence of natural gas supply at the vrbovec site. as of 2015 our gas consumption has been recorded for the new zagreb region warehouse at zvijezda. after we operationalized the new warehouse our consumption of propane butane for fork lift trucks increased from 1. 57 t in 2014 to 7. 77 t in 2015 which means that 88 of the gas was used as a result of the logistic capacity enlargement. the table below presents our propane butane consumption by purpose. 99. 8 of gas was used at the vrbovec site 92 95 of gas used to produce heat at the heating plant steam and hot water while 5 8 was used to prepare food for

en6 reduction of energy consumption compared to 2013 in 2015 we reduced our gas and electricity consumption per product unit at the vrbovec site. we reduced our electricity consumption after we raised the glycol temperature in the refrigeration sys tem from 10 to 7 c. we thereby automatically reduced the number of chillers from 5 or 6 in operation to 3 or 4 which are also the greatest electricity users. the decrease in gas consumption is a result of improved utilization of heat which was recorded in 2013 and the process continued in 2014 as result of more accurate measurement of con densate efficiency using the pm 301 dr. trap ultrasonic instrument purchased in 2013. the condensate drains are condensing pots where condensate accumulates and returns back into the system. this reduces our steam losses hot water remains in use and we need less energy for addition al heating. it was established after inspecting the drains using the new device that their replacement could improve the efficiency of steam so heated which resulted in signif icant savings of gas and water withdrawn from the bajer reservoir the total savings of water from bajer were 10 in 2014. we identified all drains and maintain records thereof and defined a plan and priorities with respect to the conden sate drain replacement. the decrease in gas consumption due to improved heat utilization is also a result of installing equipment with automated desalting and desludging of boilers in june of 2014 which also reduced the amount of wastewater from the heating plant. pik vrbovec 140water en8 total water

systematic and planned manner with a special emphasis on the hazardous waste stream and special waste stream. we continuously monitor all applicable regulations and align our business with their requirements. we constantly monitor the applicable legislation and align our business with its requirements. for that purpose we undertook numerous measures to minimize our losses and im prove our monitoring of natural resource use and thus provid ed for better control of all processes within the factory. we accomplished the following targets set for this re porting period in 2014 our entire plant waste was collected by a single or ganization which used it for its biological waste treatment operations. in addition in 2015 our entire plant waste was collected by organizations with which frikom has contracts in place so no plant waste was landfilled. in 2015 we cleaned our wastewater separators in the at mospheric sewerage system and cleaned the grease and oil traps at frikom and at the distribution refrigeration plant at autoput br. 11. in 2015 we also reduced total ammonia used to replenish the pipelines and refrigeration system due to losses record ed within the system. we repaired the heating line in a part of the factory and thus reduced our heat and water losses. the targets relating to the reconstruction of the waste water system automation of the public water withdrawal sta tion and replacement of the old hydrochloric acid tank were not accomplished because the wastewater parameters were found not to deviate in the total amount after discharging collective water from the pkb collector. we did however partially repair the hydrochloric acid tank and thus improved its safety. although the automation of the public water withdraw al station would save us substantial amounts of electricity and reduce our pump maintenance costs we monitored the relevant trends in this reporting period. after we found the costs did not significantly increase compared to the preceding reporting pe riod the investment was postponed for the next period. frikom 158materials en1 materials used by weight or volume the materials we use in the production process include raw

factory. irida s business is presently based on processing fish ery products meat processing and repacking and storage of frozen animal origin food. in 2015 the saltwater fish and mollusk processing ac tivities completely eliminated freshwater fish from produc tion. irida s daily target is to raise awareness and indicate the important role of optimizing the use of natural and production resources and to ensure environmental conservation. in mid 2015 ledo s fish packing plant in dugopolje closed and their production was transferred to irida. the increase in produc tion resulted in a significant increase in the amounts of par ticular types of waste waste paper and film. during the 2014 2015 reporting period we implement ed the following environmental management programs employee training

goods and the environment by di sasters and major accidents. no significant environmental protection investments were made during this reporting period however our employ ees awareness of the need to optimize our use of natural re sources make constant improvements and prevent and mini mize all adverse impacts on the environment water air and soil on both the local and global levels remains on a high level. according to the cleaner production methodology we under take measures to reduce our use of water and our emissions of pollutants in wastewater. irida d. o. o. complies with and implements the provi sions of all laws and regulations of the republic of croatia and the eu regulating environmental issues and endeavors to im prove its treatment of the environment to the extent possible.

system and vacuuming machines as associated process materials. they are non chlo rinated lubricants for engines and gears based on mineral oil. we also used them in the earlier years. their use increased by 1 compared to the preceding reporting period. this is a result of increased use of associated process materials and total finished product production. we also continued to use cardboard and polymeric packaging materials. compared to the preceding reporting period the amount of packaging used decreased by 30. this is mainly due to the fact that we use thermo film which is lighter than cardboard boxes we previously used for that purpose. energy en3 energy consumption within the organization direct energy consumption represents total energy consump tion from primary sources fuel

areas. compared to the preced ing reporting period our natural gas consumption decreased by 11. this is a result of more rational consumption and of dividing a single gas network into two which allowed us to heat our production plant irrespective of heating in the ad ministration building. indirect energy is energy produced outside irida. in irida such energy includes electricity ammonia refrigerant and liquid nitrogen. electricity is used to power equipment lighting and our suppliers of electricity and we monitor our consumption by using the invoices issued to us. indirect energy

surveil lance since 2012. in this reporting period out electricity con sumption increased by 7 compared to the preceding report ing period as a result of increased production. our electricity consumption is consistent with the pro duction of cleaning products because this process uses elec tricity to power the freezing tunnels temperatures between 26 c and 35 c. depending on the quantity of products the tunnel is able to operate up to 15 20 hours a day. ammonia is used as refrigerant in the primary re frigeration system. our refrigeration system is closed. the tanks and pipelines of the closed refrigeration system con tain around 300 kg of ammonia. the system is replenished with new quantities of ammnia every year because ammonia is lost when oil is discharged from the compressor. in 2015 irida s maintenance department found it unnecessary to re plenish the system. this is why our consumption of ammo nia decreased by 31 compared to the preceding reporting period.

our energy efficiency were as follows operational changes large batches continuous processes and changes in employee behavior awareness responsibility training. to constantly raise awareness of the importance of saving energy we conduct periodic trainings for our employees and thus remind them of the responsibility for and importance of actions of each individual. water en8 total water

readings for the purpose of rationalizing our water con sumption and we train our employees in rational use of wa ter. we measure our water consumption internally even when the plant is not in use on weekends or holidays to check the waterproofness of our internal water supply system. our water consumption for production purposes re mained mostly on the same level. in this reporting period our water consumption increased by 7 compared to the preceding reporting period. this increase in water consump tion is a result of an increase in the total amount of cleaning products by 11 we use which means that our water con sumption per product unit was reduced. en10 percentage and total volume of water recycled and reused irida does not reuse water and uses no recycled water. we used our best efforts to recirculate water in product which is used for cooling two packing lines. water was heated during the cooling process so it needed to be re cooled before reus ing it. as the costs of

categories. its product range includes popsicles and butter and fish packed for retail while its distribution assortment is supplemented by products provided by its parent company ledo d. d. zagreb ice cream vegetables fruits dough fish and readymade meals. as of 2015 its distribution assortment has been enhanced by prod ucts supplied under the popular jami brand of bosnia and her zegovina a leader in the production of traditional frozen dough products. its overall distribution assortment comprises approxi mately 600 products distributed at approximately 13. 500 stores. the year 2014 was particularly difficult for business in bosnia and herzegovina. natural disasters that affected a large part of the country caused substantial damage and deepened the economic crisis. the unfavorable market conditions also re flected on our business so our production decreased compared to the earlier years and adversely affected our indicators with in the environmental management system. substantial efforts were used to improve our business performance. compared to 2013 the number of our customers and active supply points de creased by 13 which is an additional indicator of the difficult economic situation. our business results in 2015 were better than those in 2014 however the total quantity of products made is still be low the figures recorded in the earlier years as a result of more finished product inventories. the reduced scope of production in both years also resulted in negative trends with respect to con sumption intensity and emissions per ton of finished product as we use energy for other processes within the company as well. by enlarging our distribution assortment we increased the total amount of distributed products compared to the pre ceding reporting period. good planning of transport routes and distribution optimization resulted in good indicators of fuel con sumption intensity and emissions per ton of distributed product. in late 2015 new guidelines for calculating emissions from stationary sources were adopted in line with the eu guide lines. as our former calculation of emissions was performed ac cording to a slightly different principle due to our use of heating oil we performed new calculations for both reporting periods to be able to logically compare and address any variations. the activities planned for this reporting period were based on our plans to reorganize the production plants across ledo group. by changing our business decision and retaining the existing product range we were forced to revise our plans in the area of environmental protection as well. the following results were achieved during the preceding reporting period we invested funds in improvement of our waste storage facil ities which was a condition precedent to obtaining a license to export fish to the eu we began to fit out our municipal waste area and solve the problem of the pallets accumulated in 2014 we obtained a new water

converted from heating oil to more ecolog ically acceptable and environmentally friendly natural gas. the dairy factory switched from mazut to natural gas thus resolving a huge environmental issue. the new and recon structed farms use natural gas for heating purposes. the company cars are new and have smaller engines which re sults in a reduced diesel fuel consumption. moreover belje uses satellite navigation to control the consumption of fuel and movements of company vehicles. significant amounts of wastewater produced as a result of washing the milk pipes on dairy farms are transported to the two biogas plants owned by agrokor energija d. o. o. on the territory of baranja. in this manner the company achieves cost savings since there is no need to use the services of a licensed waste disposal contrac tor. some of the slurry from pig farms is also transported to be used for electricity production purposes. the energy gen erated during electricity production is used

most of the production takes place between the lim channel in the south and the mirna river in the north. in this area the company has vineyards olive orchards vegetable plantations and fields where crops used for purposes of the company s own sheep farm are grown. the benefits of the istrian soil and cli mate in combination with the expertise and know how of agro laguna s management result in raw materials of recognizable quality. this quality is also inherent in our products wine oil and milk processed into cheese. this is why protection of au thenticity of the istrian table is one of the important elements of our business. in addition to the wine whose geographic or igin is traditionally protected the company also produces oil whose authenticity is currently protected only at the national level while approval of the authentic product label at the eu level is still pending. agrolaguna is a member of a group of producers that make efforts to protect the authenticity of is trian cheese with one of the recognizable value adding labels. we hope that customers throughout the eu will recognize the quality and the specific character of istrian products and that agrolaguna s products will no longer be used on local tables only but more and more on european and international tables as well. in any case agrolaguna s products are equal members of the european family of protected food products. agrolaguna s processing plants are located at several dif grape and olive processing is performed seasonally at the end of the calendar summer and during the fall months. the aging and further development of the products take place throughout the entire year. as far as wine is concerned it is important to ensure controlled and properly managed fermentation and ag ing in barrique barrels. the process ends by bottling the prod uct and shipping it to be sold in the market. cheese production takes place at sites in the surroundings of tar. the area includes pastures a sheep farm and a cheese fac tory. in addition to sheep milk produced by the company itself agrolaguna also purchases certain amounts of sheep and cow milk from contractors from all over istria. in this manner agro laguna encourages production on family farms which provides a source of livelihood to a portion of the local population. most of the products are marketed through domestic de partment store chains while export is becoming more and more important as well. agrolaguna d. d. is committed to continuous improvement of its products. the quality of input raw materials depends con siderably on seasonal conditions which is yet another distinc tive feature of agrolaguna s production business. the company therefore has a twofold development goal one is to emphasize the specific qualities and variations among different harvests and the other is to ensure a stable and recognizable product quality. in order to meet customer demands and expectations raise the quality of our services and products while respecting the principles of environmental protection and sustainable de velopment agrolaguna implements a unique integrated man agement system which includes a quality management system a food safety management system and an environmental pro tection management system. the company has received the iso 9001 2008 iso 14001 2004 and haccp certificates. the cheese and olive oil products have also been kosher certified. agrolaguna managed to find a solution to the problem caused by wastewater produced on the pin farm which was one of the goals set for this reporting period. wastewater from the milking area and the milk storage on the pin dairy farm were redirected to the wastewater treatment plant that operates within the cheese factory. in this manner the company ensured that this type of wastewater is also treated until it reaches the level of quality that is considered suitable for discharge to the environment. the funds invested in the mentioned activities amounted to hrk 151 607. 01. the water management license issued for the pin rural estate will be revised to include the adjustments made with respect to the changed conditions and changes in legal regulations. installation of new collection facilities and wastewater treatment plants at the site where the company s winery oil plant and administration building are located will be co fi nanced by the eu. the works are currently in progress. by the end of 2015 most of the construction works were completed and the assembly of equipment also commenced. until the fall of 2016 the use and occupancy certificate and the revised wa ter management license should be obtained. in this reporting period the company participated in a project implemented by the faculty of food technology and biotechnology of the university of zagreb as a project part ner. the aim of the project was to investigate whether bioac tive compositions which could be used in food and cosmetics industry could be separated from the waste generated during wine production. in this reporting period a new company called e kolek tor became part of the agrokor system. agrolaguna established cooperation with the said company in the field of waste dispos al thanks to which it obtained plastic foil and paper cardboard press containers. furthermore the company expects to gener ate two new types of waste after the new wastewater pretreat ment plant built at the site where the winery and oil factory are located is commissioned. agrolaguna www. sirspin. hr prica o pinucmycmmycycmykoglas a4 katalog zigante tisak. pdf 1 21 06 16

compared it is evident that the amount of total materials used decreased in 2014 and increased in 2015. the main cause of variability in the amount of materials used is the climatic conditions which also cause variations in yields and types of products. the non renewable materials used by agrolaguna in clude liquid petroleum derivatives heating oil diesel fuels gasoline and lpg. type of material

increase in fuel consumption even in 2014 when the volume of production was slightly smaller. fossil fuels are used for transportation purposes and regardless of the amount of products being transported fuel consumption will be similar if the route is the same. the recorded increase in fuel consumption is a result of transporting goods to more distant destinations and a slightly increased number of busi ness trips. moreover fuel consumption also partly depends on the intensity of using agricultural machinery and dura tion of the heating season. energy en3 energy consumption within the organization total energy consumption includes consumption of fuel au tomobile gas for forklifts lpg and electricity. energy con sumption depends on the type of product type of packaging and volume. total energy consumption gj 2014 2015 fuel 14 710 17 718 automobile gas 167 180 lpg 3 616 6 884 electricity 6 650 8 193 total 25 143 32 975 in 2013 total fuel consumption from non renewable sources fuel automobile gas lpg amounted to 15 383 gj. fuel con sumption increased in this reporting period which corresponds with the data on the consumption of non renewable materials. variations in fuel consumption at production plants depend on the dynamics of product bottling and amount of processed raw materials. considering the seasonal character and the climatic impacts the amount of raw materials varies from year to year and between different parts of the year. dif ferent technological processes with different energy require ments are conducted during different parts of the year. as far as the two reporting years are concerned 2014 was a rath er wet year which caused more intensive use of machinery in the effort to protect the plantations. the volume of cheese production grew in both reporting years which caused an in crease in the consumption of steam used in milk processing and the consumption of lpg used to produce such steam. in its warehousing and storage activities agrolagu na uses lpg forklifts and the ecologically acceptable and environmentally friendly electric forklifts. lpg consump tion depends on logistic processes and the rate of handling finished goods and processed and unprocessed input materi als. as an alternative type of fuel lpg has a less significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions compared to other fossil fuels. combustion of lpg is clean and it is a high octane and ecologically acceptable fuel. it is supplied in returnable 10 kg gas cylinders. by using electric forklifts the company reduc es fuel consumption and noise pollution as well as improves the quality of air in its storage facilities. agrolaguna 187en5 energy intensity energy intensity gj kom 2014 2015 electricity 0. 00402 0. 00841 fuel 0. 00144 0. 00209 energy

requirements of different types of packaging 0. 5 l 0. 75 l 1. 0 l 5. 0 l etc. and different processes associat ed with production. considering the fact that the machines do not have separate energy consumption meters only the average energy consumption for all types of products can be presented. en6 reduction of energy consumption compared to 2013 energy intensity grew in this reporting period average 0. 006215. if the two reporting years are compared to 2013 separately it is evident that the amount of energy consumed per product unit was smaller in both 2014 and 2015 albeit the reduction was slightly more significant in 2015. such variations are caused by different energy re quirements of different products. a more detailed analysis requires additional data. water en8 total water withdrawal by source most of the water used by agrolaguna comes from the pub lic water supply system. the kampaladanja site is the only company site where water needed for irrigation purposes has been withdrawn from ground sources since 2014. a water treatment and management project is currently construction of accumulation lakes with treated water from the municipal water treatment plant. according to the plan prepared by the local authorities the mentioned water will be used for irrigation purposes. after the completion of the project some of the water withdrawn from the public water supply system could therefore be replaced by recycled water. total water withdrawal by source m 3 year from wells from the public water supply system total volume of water withdrawn 2014 9 104 38 026 47 130 2015 6 504 62 277 68 781 variations in water consumption depend on two factors climatic conditions wet or dry year in terms of the volume of water required for irrigation purposes amount of processed raw materials in terms of the yield and characteristics of different raw materials. since the water withdrawal concession agreement was signed in 2014 ground water was not consumed in the previ ous period. furthermore withdrawn water is used to irrigate vegetable plantations. therefore the volume of water con sumed is in proportion with the total surface area of vegeta ble plantations and the shares of individual crops since each crop has different irrigation requirements. the amount of water withdrawn from the public water supply system depends on two factors olive orchards and vineyards are irrigated using the water from the municipal water supply system in the critical period of 2014 the amount of precipitation water was over whelming and the cost of water consumed for irrigation purposes was consequently significantly lower since the company used a smaller amount of input raw materials in 2014 the volume of water used to wash the plants also decreased. water consumption in 2015 was at the similar level as in 2013. agrolaguna 188en9 water sources significantly affected by withdrawal of water most of the water used by agrolaguna comes from the mu nicipal water supply system. since the volume of water with drawn from the public water supply system by agrolaguna is relatively small compared to the overall water consumption from the municipal water supply network agrolaguna s di rect impact on water sources is negligible. in addition sever al water springs in istria and the butoniga accumulation lake have been integrated into a separate water supply network so that in case any of the sources is compromised the required volumes can be withdrawn from other sources. emissions effluents and waste en15 direct greenhouse gas ghg emissions scope

on the quali ty of liquid petroleum fuels og 33 2011 dated january 1 2013 agrolaguna uses medium heating oil i with a reduced sulfur content in the heating plant of its winery. according to the basic specifications total sulfur content in medium heat ing oil is 2. 8 m m whereas medium heating oil i contains no more than 1. 0 m m sulfur. the company optimized the routes of employee transporta tion buses freight vehicles and company cars as well as the amount of goods and the number of employees transported in one round. in this way the company managed to reduce its consumption of liquid fuels by 1. 8 in 2014 and by another 0. 5 in 2015 total reduction 2. 3 . the mentioned reduc tion in liquid fuel consumption resulted in a reduction of emissions by the same percentage. agrolaguna 189en20 emissions of ozone depleting substances ods no cooling gases were released in the previous years. also the freon type gases were replaced by ozone friendly refrig erants. freon type gases are however used in the cooling systems of all company sites i. e. in the vegetable refrigerator in the a c systems installed at the ripening facilities in the cooling system of the cheese and curd storage as well as in the system used to cool the pressed grapes and young wine during fermentation and wine in the winery. en21 no x so x and other significant air emissions air emissions t year so2no2co 2014

result of an increase in fuel consumption. at the same time a decrease in emissions of so recorded in 2015 reflects the smaller sulfur content in the fuel. if fuel combustion efficiency was increased emissions of so and co would be reduced. in order to achieve that the company would have to invest in heating plants. according to the measurement of air emissions from heating devices at all production sites it is evident that air emissions are within the allowed limits. as far as the heat capacity and type of fuel are con cerned agrolaguna uses boilers that belong to the category of small and medium sized heating devices regulation on the limit values for emissions of air pollutants from sta tionary sources regulation on elvs. en22 total water discharge by quality and destination the amount of wastewater discharged from the processing facilities is equal to the volume of water supplied from the municipal water supply system. the total volume of water discharged is in proportion with the production volume. year total water discharge m 2014 39 096 2015 39 921 total 79 017 after having prepared the project documents obtained the relevant licenses and applied for co financing agrolaguna ex pects that the project aimed at improving wastewater treat in the next reporting period. the construction of the envis aged wastewater treatment plant started already in 2015 and is expected to be completed in 2016. the construction works should be completed by the beginning of may 2016 while the equipment is planned to be installed by the beginning of july. until the grape harvest the company plans to obtain the use and occupancy permit and the revised water management license. during the harvest the company will test use the new facility under maximum load and optimize the related param eters according to the test results. at the beginning of 2017 the company plans to reach the final agreement with odvod process wastewater produced by agrolaguna using the named company s biological processing facility as well as concern ing the treatment of waste sludge using the named company s sludge composting facility. both facilities are currently under co financed by the eu. the public health institute of the istrian county is responsible for monitoring the quality of treated wastewater. the frequen cy of such monitoring is prescribed by law. the institute is also responsible for preparing an analytical report on the quality of the treated wastewater. pursuant to the ordinance on limit val ues of hazardous and other substances in wastewater waste water sample analyses are made and compliance of the results obtained is assessed. the results of the analysis of the sample of wastewater produced by the cheese factory and the dairy farm after it has been physically chemically and biologically treated were in compliance with the requirements for releasing water in the environment. as far as the winery and oil factory are con cerned all parameters except for the chemical oxygen demand and biochemical oxygen demand after 5 days will comply with the prescribed values after the new wastewater pretreatment plant is built. the melted organic matter which causes high lev els of cod and bod can be eliminated only if wastewater is bi ologically treated. this is why agrolaguna must sign a contract with a utility company concerning the collection and process ing of such type of wastewater pursuant to which the relevant utility company s biological wastewater treatment plant which is currently under construction would be used for the said pur poses. if the biological treatment plant is not finished by the defined deadline the company will be forced to make addition al investments in the amount of approx. hrk 5 000 000. 00 for biological treatment of wastewater. considering the volume of wastewater produced in the grape processing period a biore actor with a capacity of no less than 700 m equipped with an aerator and a tank for storing surplus active sludge generated during the biological treatment process would be required in that case. this demonstrates how important it is for economic operators that the municipal utility infrastructure in their envi ronment offers sufficient qualitative capacity. agrolaguna 190en23 total weight of waste by type and disposal method the table below shows the amounts of waste

achieved an income from the sale of waste in the amount of hrk 11 340. 50 while the cost of waste disposal amounted to hrk 124 849. 89. the wastewater treatment plant within the cheese fac tory produces sludge and floatants that are used as renew able energy sources at the gradec biogas plant for electricity and thermal energy generation. thanks to energija gradec agrolaguna incurs no expenditures concerning the collection and disposal of the mentioned sludge and the whey produced as a by product in the cheese production process. the cost of waste transportation is covered by agrokor energija d. o. o. despite the fact that the cost of transportation is greater than the associated income as the plant is quite far away. the only permanent sustainable solution would be the construction of a biogas plant in the istrian county. compliance en29 monetary value of significant fines and total number of non monetary sanctions for noncompliance with environmental laws and

and the amount of goods and the num ber of employees being transported. by converting to gas forklifts the company recorded an increase in gas consump tion compared to the preceding reporting period while the consumption of liquid fuel consequently decreased. the de cision to convert to gas forklifts also resulted in a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from combustion of petroleum derivatives and an increase in emissions caused by consump tion of lpg. total emissions from both sources indicate a decreasing trend. agrolaguna 191environmental protection investments en31 total environmental protection expenditures and investments by type as a responsible company agrolaguna d. d. is committed to achieving further economic development respecting the prin ciples of environmental protection. in this reporting period environmental protection expenditures and investments in cluded the cost of waste disposal and investments in waste water treatment plants. in 2014 the company invested hrk 190 000 on activities re lated to the preparation of the wastewater treatment plant con struction project and another hrk 12 000 in 2015. the project is expected to be completed in 2016 when most of the invest ments will be booked. the waste management expenditures amounted to hrk 162 232 in 2014 and hrk 129 449 in 2015. year waste disposal emission treatment and remediation costs hrk prevention

costs remained at similar levels. for ex ample waste disposal costs amounted to hrk 151 285. 58 in 2013 which is fairly similar to the costs recorded in 2014. a somewhat smaller amount recorded in 2015 can be ascribed to regular variations in collection and transportation dates. for example the olive oil sediment was collected and trans ported for disposal at the beginning of 2016 instead of in december 2015. plans for the next reporting period in the next reporting period the company plans to complete the construction of the process wastewater pretreatment plant which will be used by the winery and oil factory as well as to obtain the use and occupancy permit and the revised water management license for the site concerned. the company also plans to adjust the water management license is sued for the cheese factory and the pin farm to the new conditions and changed legal regulations. in the next reporting period the company further plans to make investments in agricultural machinery and thus achieve further reductions in fuel consumption air and soil emissions cost of maintenance and its environmental impacts as well as increase operational efficiency. the company also plans to restore the pesticide storage in order to ensure that the method of storing pesticides and the storage capacity are in line with the needs. furthermore pursuant to the regulation on the content of the action program for the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources og 7 13 the company is required to ensure sufficient slurry storage capacities by july 2017. agrolaguna 192pik vinkovci d. d. w as established in 1962. in 1994 the company became a member of the agrokor group as the first company engaged in primary agricultural produc tion. its activities include primary field and vegetable crop production processing and storing of fruit and vegetables so pot and lipovac sites storing of grains and oil plants storing and sale of production materials seed enhancement vinkovci site and livestock production including pig farming andri fattening zvirinac farm. pik vinkovci also includes two fruit one in ka tele. pik vinkovci bases its operations on organized man agement systems designed in accordance with the principle of sustainable development. the environmental management system designed in ac cordance with the requirements of the iso 14001 standard was implemented in 2010 into the already existing integrat ed quality management system designed according to the re quirements of the iso 9001 haccp and globalgap standards. in 2014 the company introduced the ohsas the occupation al health and safety management system specification. the organization has recognized the risks associated with each workplace allowed insight into those risks to all employees adopted appropriate risk mitigation measures and defined on the basis of the measures adopted goals whose achievement is monitored in order to raise the awareness of its employees of the dangers associated with their workplaces and reduce the number of occupational injuries to the minimum. in june 2015 two new systems were certified namely iscc interna tional sustainability and carbon certification system and dunav soja. the purpose of iscc certification was to allow the company to trade in iscc goods and achieve better sale pric es. the iscc demonstrates the company s responsibilities and compliance in the following areas reduction of greenhouse gas emissions sustainable land use protection of natural biospheres increase in social responsibility. in addition to regular annual and external audits the organization makes systematic and continuous efforts to im prove the safety of all employees raise the quality of its prod ucts achieve sustainable agricultural production as well as ensure rational raw material and energy consumption and sustainable waste management. in order to create the preconditions for achieving sus tainable development the company defines concrete goals for each year. by achieving these goals the organization contrib utes immensely to reducing the impacts on all environmental components and by achieving the goals defined particularly for the field of environmental protection it ensures realization of further improvements that lead to the reduction of adverse environmental impacts. the most important goals achieved in this reporting period ect was completed in the spring of 2014 with the aim of reducing environmental pollution caused by precipitation oily water drainage. the quality of wastewater produced at the sopot and lipovac sites and the andrija evci 1 an regular desludging of the separators and regular system maintenance. all wastewater quality parameters comply with the maximum amounts allowed defined under the rel evant water management licenses. replacement of old equipment in transformation stations at the matija gubec site in vinkovci old compensation bat teries containing pcb were replaced and new ones were in stalled. on the basis of a concession agreement the company was permitted to withdraw water from its own well on the . the agreement was signed in february 2015. employee education in sustainable pesticide use accord ing to the regulation on establishing a framework for ac tion to achieve sustainable pesticide use og 142 12 the company conducted training for professional pesticide us ers distributors and advisers. a total of 175 workers par ticipated in the training sessions held in february and no vember 2015. measuring of air emissions from stationary

pollutants from stationary sources og 117 12 90 14 at the following sites matija gubec in vinkovci so procurement of new containers the waste management per and cardboard containers installed by a licensed paper and cardboard waste disposal contractor. procurement of a new oil and grease separator for the sopot site the separator was installed with the aim of achieving and maintaining the quality of wastewater produced as a re sult of washing agricultural machinery. the separator was installed at the end of may 2014. increase in energy efficiency at the sopot site project doc uments for replacing the primary energy source used in the heating plant heating oil and improving the energy effi ciency of the commercial building were prepared in may 2014. the project was co financed by the environmental protection and energy efficiency fund. a new boiler pow ered by pellets was installed as part of the project. it en sures higher levels of heat utilization and lower levels of co emissions. furthermore insulation of external walls of pik vinkovci 193the commercial building was performed and wood joinery was replaced by pvc joinery. replacement of asbestos plates this goal has not been achieved. it refers to large production facilities with approx. 8 800 asbestos plates. since substantial investments would be required to repair all the facilities at once the company plans to replace the concerned roof plates successively in accordance with the identified roof repair needs as deter mined by the maintenance department. it has thus been determined that roof repair is necessary in the case of one of the production facilities at the company s site in vinkovci and is scheduled to be performed in the next period. materials en1 materials used by weight or volume type

water withdrawal were obtained on the basis of measurements conducted and readings of installed water meters. groundwater withdrawn from own wells is used as process water for production purposes at the company s pig zvirinac cattle fattening farm. the water used at pig farms is processed while the water used at the cattle fattening farm is raw unprocessed. the company withdraws surface water from the bosut and the increase in water consumption from the public water supply system in 2015 is a result of the testing of the fire hydrant network and improvement of the fire protection tank at the site in matija gubec street in vinkovci and the loss of water due to breakdowns and broken pipes. the volume of water withdrawn from wells increased compared to the previous period. in february and march 2015 water stored in the water tower on the andrija evci 2 farm spilled into the nearby channel due to water tower probe failure which caused an increase in water consumption. in 2015 the volume of water withdrawn for irrigation purposes from surface waters and wells increased compared to 2014 as a result of low precipitation levels and irregular occurrence of precipitation during the vegetative season. in the period of intensive irrigation from may to july 2015 60 less precipitation was recorded compared to 2014. compared to the preceding reporting period total wa ter consumption decreased due to a smaller need for irri gation water in 2014 since precipitation regularly occurred during the vegetative season. en9 water sources significantly affected by withdrawal of water pik

negligibly by 0. 84. the mentioned decrease in production was caused by the smaller share of sugar beet in crop rotation which further re sulted in a proportionate reduction of energy consumption. en6 reduction of energy consumption fuel consumption recorded in the preceding reporting peri od amounted to 114 491. 00 gj. in the 2014 2015 reporting period fuel consumption amounted to 103. 811. 00 gj. it is evident that fuel consumption decreased by 9. 3. the reduc tion in fuel consumption was to a large extent contributed by the renewal of the fleet used by the field and vegetable crop farming pc. diesel fuel consumption decreased because the company started applying new production technologies and reduced its soil treatment activities. natural gas consump tion decreased thanks to favorable climatic conditions and the consequent reduction in intensity of operation of the dry ing facility. water en8 total water withdrawal by source in 2015 the company recorded a negligible increase in the volume of water withdrawn from wells due to an increase in total farm production volume. the volume of water consumed from the municipal supplies decreased thanks to the installa tion of a remote

accumulation lake increased by 104. 3 in 2015 reaching 1 336 050 m since the crops planted in the grabovo fields are more difficult to cultivate and require more wa ter. furthermore the surface area of the fields where vege table crops were planted during the initial planting period increased by 13 ha in 2015 to the detriment of the field crops vegetable crops require more water than field crops. be cause of the same reasons the volume of water withdrawn from the wells and the municipal supply network increased by 13 2 and 4. 3 respectively. if the two reporting periods are compared it is evident that the increase in the volume of water withdrawn from the grabovo lake increased in this reporting period by 11. 4 while the volume of water withdrawn from wells increased by 20. such an increase in water withdrawal is justified by the fact that in 2012 and 2013 subsequent planting was per formed on 176 ha compared to 278 ha planted in 2014 and 2015. the 20 increase in water withdrawal from wells is a result of an increase in production on the farms. vupik 203emissions effluents and waste en15 direct greenhouse gas ghg emissions scope 1 direct greenhouse gas emissions t

sites that discharge wastewater into the soil. water discharge costs i. e. fees could be significantly reduced by investing in wastewater flow meters. if total water discharge values recorded in 2014 and 2015 are compared to the preceding reporting period from the aspect of quality it is evident that the volume of water discharged increased by 118. 58 . this increase occurred after the company obtained water management licenses for all its sites. more precisely pursuant to new legal regu lations the volume of water discharged at sites that do not have wastewater flow meters installed is set to 40 of total water sources affected by withdrawal. using the mentioned 40 as the basis for calculation water discharge fees were determined for such sites as well which was not the case in the preceding reporting period. en23 total weight of waste by type and disposal method in 2014 the total amount of non hazardous waste collected by collecting organizations from temporary waste disposal areas at vupik sites decreased by 17 compared to 2013. in the structure of non hazardous waste the amount of the col lected plastic and paper packaging increased and the amount of iron decreased. the amount of hazardous waste decreased by 25 compared to the preceding reporting period. the company takes care of the health of its animals and makes efforts to reduce the amount of drugs used which result ed in a decrease in infectious and pharmaceutical waste in this reporting period. on the basis of the related certificate received the company committed itself to adhere to the prin ciple of sustainable development. the company s goals i. e. reduction of waste and waste disposal costs can be achieved through education and efforts aimed at raising the awareness of the need to separate waste. in 2015 vupik produced 175 695 t of non hazardous waste i. e. 9. 3 more than in 2014 due to an increase in the amount of raw materials used in production. the same year the company produced 14

technology that takes maximum advantage of the natural qualities of the area where it is located clean environment large num ber of sunny days pleasant wind. the first written records about salt pans on pag date from the 9th century which con firms the fact that the conditions this region offers are truly favorable for salt production. the several hundred years old tradition of salt production commits us to maintain customer loyalty by creating quality products. in 1995 solana pag d. d. became a member of the agrokor group and started expanding its product mix. besides fine and coarse sea salt the company today also produces salt flower dishwasher salt bathing salt and seasoned salt. solana pag is a combined solar thermal salt pan. this means that 90 of production takes place in outdoor ponds and 10 in the industrial plant under controlled conditions. in this manner the share of impure substances from the salt is reduced to the minimum and the quality of salt is enhanced. the process of producing salt from the sea starts by releas ing seawater with particular initial concentration of salt into the shallow pond system where it is exposed to the sun and the wind. it is where 90 of the water evaporates naturally. the condensed seawater brine is then transferred into the vacuum evaporation station where the salt crystalizes. the so obtained salt is iodized dried sieved and packed or it is stored non iodized for further use. from the beginning of the production process until the finished product salt is tested in the company s laboratory and as far as food safety and qual ity control aspects are concerned it is also continuously con trolled by accredited state laboratories as well as sanitary and veterinary inspections. having put in place and implemented the quality envi ronmental protection and food safety policy solana pag has ensured safety and quality of its operations as well as com pliance of the entire production process from seawater with drawal to the finished product and the resulting environmen tal impacts with requirements of the codex alimentarius and the iso 14001 2004 standard. in 2006 our haccp system was certified according to the requirements of the codex al imentarius. in 2009 solana pag s products were kosher cer tified. in 2011 solana pag started implementing an environ mental management system certified in accordance with the requirements of the iso 14001 2004 standard. in 2014 the company started implementing the coarse salt washing plant project. the implementation continued throughout 2015. the company installed a new drying facil ity and a new mill thus making additional positive steps in the environmental protection segment in terms of reduction of consumption and replacement of the previously used en ergy source with a new more environmentally friendly one the company switched from medium heating oil to extra light heating oil. in doing so it also improved the quality of ex haust gases. the results of these improvements will be largely noticed in the next reporting period. the company is currently in the process of receiving the national protected designation of origin label for pag salt and pag salt flower. the initial surveillance audits of the haccp and iso 14001 2004 systems were performed. the auditors estab lished that the non compliances identified during last year s recertification

consumption from renewable sources year wood biomass gj 2014 99 000 2015 150 000 total 249 000 in 2015 fuel consumption non renewable energy sources increased compared to 2014. medium heating oil consumption decreased because the small boiler powered by this type of fuel operated for only three months. afterwards medium heating oil former ly used for salt drying purposes was replaced by extra light heating oil new drying facility which was used for the rest of the year. the increased consumption therefore refers to the use of extra light heating oil. compared to 2014 lpg consumption slightly increased in 2015 as a result of an increased goods loading frequency rate and the use of forklifts in the process of replacing the old drying facility. the amount of wood used for thermal energy production in 2015 10 000 t increased compared to 2014 6 699 t due to an extended production period and the larger salt production output. compared to the preceding reporting period con sumption of all types of fuel increased due to an extended period of production. total electricity consumption year electricity gj 2014 7 749 2015 8 265 total 16 014 compared to 2014 electricity consumption increased in 2015 as a result of an extended period of production and an in creased salt production output. the amount of electricity used in the preceding reporting period was greater than in 2015 even though the production period was shorter and the pro duction volume smaller thanks to the installation of a new drying facility and its mode of operation that resulted in a reduction of energy consumption. more precisely the new drying facility operates independently from the rest of the pro duction process and the biomass heating plant. consequently less electricity is used particularly when the production plant is inactive i. e. when all that is left to be done is to dry the salt. en5 energy intensity year energy intensity gj t 2014 10. 87 2015 9. 40 energy intensity is the ratio of total energy consumption to total production volume. energy intensity calculations for 2014 and 2015 look as follows it is evident that compared to 2014 energy intensity de creased in 2015. the amount of energy consumed depends on the input raw material i. e. the concentration of salt in the in put raw material. to produce salt from the brine the remain ing water must be evaporated before salt can start to crystal ize in the vacuum evaporation station. 2015 was an excellent year for brine production. thanks to favorable weather condi tions i. e. extremely dry and sunny days the average concen tration of salt in the brine was 23 6 b compared to 2014 when it was below 21 b. as a result a smaller volume of water had to be evapo rated from the brine to achieve the same salt production out put. consequently a smaller amount of energy was needed in 2015 as well. en6 reduction of energy consumption in the course of 2015 the amount of thermal energy required per unit of salt produced was smaller due to already men tioned reasons favorable weather conditions during summer months. hence a smaller volume of water had to be evapo rated from the condensed seawater to achieve the same pro duction volume and consequently less thermal energy was needed to complete the evaporation process. the required amount of electricity per unit of salt pro duced also decreased in 2015 127. 6 kwh t salt compared to 2014 199. 3 kwh t salt. what contributed to the mentioned solana pag 213reduction in energy consumption were the improved quality of the input raw material and production system modifications. in 2015 the company installed a new drying facility that operates independently from the rest of the production process and the biomass heating plant. the commissioning of the new drying facility resulted in a reduction of electricity consump tion particularly at times when the production plant is inactive. water en8 total water withdrawal by source m 3 year brine cooling seawater public water supply system total volume of water withdrawn 2014 61 000 1 046 400 21 179 1 128 579 2015 91 500 1 593 600 25 260 1 710 360 total 152 500 2 640 000 46 439 2 838 939 compared to the year before a larger amount of brine was processed in 2015. the volume of the cooling seawater was in line with the previous reports. in 2015 the company also recorded an increase in consumption of municipal water supplies due to an extended production period. it is important to note that compared to 2014 con sumption of municipal water supplies per unit of salt pro duced 1. 403 m t decreased in 2015 1. 961 m t. the men tioned decrease is a result of the replacement of the old dry ing facility with a new one that operates independently from the biomass heating plant particularly at times when the production plant is inactive. in the preceding reporting peri od the total number of water sources affected by withdrawal was smaller as the production period was shorter. emissions effluents

2015 the company recorded an increase in co emissions as a result of an increased fuel consumption compared to 2014. since fuel consumption and the related co emissions generation are closely correlated with the duration and vol ume of production the increased amount of co emissions is a result of the larger salt production output. the amount of fuel used for transportation purposes loading trucks other trucks is similar to the amount recorded in 2014. compared to the preceding reporting period the val ues increased in proportion with the production volume. co emissions per unit of salt produced amounted to 0. 49 t t of salt in 2015 while co emissions per unit of salt produced recorded in the preceding reporting period amounted to 0. 42 t t of salt. en16 energy indirect

result of an increase in electricity consumption required to chop wood into wood fuel biomass to meet the increased production fuel demand. compared to the preceding reporting period total emissions decreased by 6 since electricity consumption dropped after the new dry ing facility was commissioned. solana pag 214en18 greenhouse gas ghg emissions intensity in order to calculate the intensity of direct greenhouse gas emissions in 2015 the company used the ratio of emissions in tons of co equivalent for the amount of wood biomass used in 2015 7926. 7 t and the salt production volume re corded that same year 18 000 t. hence co emissions per ton of salt produced amounted to 0. 44 t in 2015. in 2014 co emissions per ton of salt produced amounted to 0. 48 t. in order to calculate the intensity of indirect greenhouse gas emissions in 2015 the company used the ratio of emissions in tons of co equivalent for the amount of electricity used in 2015 1 994 355 kwh and the salt production volume record ed that same year 18 000 t. hence co emissions per ton of salt produced amounted to 0. 026 t in 2015. in 2014 co emissions per ton of salt produced amounted to 0 037 t. en19 reduction of greenhouse gas emissions instead of using non renewable energy sources the compa ny uses a co neutral thermal energy production technology wood biomass. in addition a new drying facility was commis sioned in 2015. the company also switched from medium heat ing oil to extra light heating oil thus improving the quality of exhaust gases. en20 emissions of ozone depleting substances ods in its

increased also due to higher carbon monoxide emission val ues obtained during air emission measurement carried out in 2015 large boiler wood biomass. compared to the preceding reporting period the com pany recorded a decrease in air emissions of no. a decreas ing trend has been recorded ever since the new drying facili ty was commissioned and the small mazut boiler was decom missioned. en22 total water discharge by quality and destination year total water discharge m 2014 1 125 112 2015 1 703 742 total 2 828 854 the wastewater discharged into the municipal sewage system includes process cooling sanitary and precipitation water. the amount of wastewater in 2015 was in proportion with the amount of water withdrawn from the sea and other sources. from the total content of brine the salt crystalizes the evapo rated part condenses and as such is released into the sea while the rest is the base alkali which is also discharged into the sea. before being discharged sanitary wastewater is treated in an aerobic wastewater treatment plant through biological pro cesses while process wastewater is treated in a sedimentation tank through physical processes. pursuant to the water management license issued by hrvatske vode a water management company on july 8 2014 valid until january 1 2017 class up i 325 04 14 05 87 reg. no. 374 24 3 14 5 lp discharging of the follow ing wastewater into the sea is allowed sanitary treated in a solana pag 215biological wastewater treatment plant process and cooling wastewater. the license also prescribes the sampling fre quency. wastewater sampling and quality analysis are per formed by the zadar public health institute. the values of measured parameters obtained from all wastewater analyses comply with the requirements pre scribed under the water management license allowing the discharge of wastewater into the municipal sewage system except for process wastewater. more precisely during the production campaign the values obtained on three out of six measurement occasions parameter suspended particles did not comply with the prescribed values. it is therefore nec essary to perform reconstruction of the deposit tank in 2016. en23 total

categories or innovation in categories in which orkla already holds strong positions. creating new growth platforms i. e. in areas additional to orkla s current activities will also be a key priority

innovation opportunities and solutions that do not naturally lie within the scope of the present busi ness ar eas or organisational structure and opportunities that are relevant for several companies

areas for innovation at orkla therefore include taste and sensory experience health and nutrition sustainability and environment and packaging innovation. good examples of innovation in 2014 are polly melkesjokolade a new environmentally friendly bottle from felix and beauvais ketchup and omo aktiv sport laundry detergent. other examples are paul ns superlunch soups which have won a swedish award

changes in individual categories. erent business areas are exposed to currency risk to varying degrees and in 2014 the weakening of the norwegian and swedish krone resulted in higher purchasing costs.

c purposes and are granted for a period no longer than until the next general meeting. the general meeting is given the opportu nity to vote on every purpose covered by the authorisation. at the annual general meeting in 2014 the board of directors was granted authorisation to buy back up to 100 000 000 orkla shares so that the company can acquire and hold up to 10 of its share capital. the authorisation is limited to speci c purposes and applies until the annual general meeting in 2015. shares acquired under this authorisation are to be cancelled or used in connection with employee

the general meeting that a departure be made from the pre emptive right of existing shareholders in the event of a capital increase such a proposal will be justi ed by the com mon interests of the company and the shareholders and the grounds for the proposal will be presented in the notice of the general meeting. to avoid any detriment to the group s reputation the board considers it important to pursue a policy of transparency and caution in connection with investments that could be perceived as an unfortunately close involvement or close relationship between the company and a member of the board executive management or parties related thereto. procedural rules for such transactions have therefore been drawn up in the rules of procedure for the board of directors which may be found on orkla s website under investor relations. according to the rules of procedure the board chair must be informed of such transactions and must decide how the matter should be dealt with. if the matter concerns the board chair this duty is incum bent upon the deputy chair of the board. further information on transactions between related parties is provided in note 37 to the consolidated

immaterial transactions between companies within the group where there are minority shareholders. the rules of procedure further establish that a board member must not take part in the consideration of or a decision on an issue that is of such importance to himself or herself or to any related party that the member must be considered to have an obvious personal or nancial interest in the matter. it is incumbent upon each board member to consider on an ongoing basis whether there are matters which from annual report 2014corporate governance an objective point of view are liable to undermine the general con dence in that board member s independence and im partiality or which could give rise to con icts of interest in connection with the board of directors consideration of the matter. such matters must be taken up with the board chair. according to the orkla code of conduct employees must on their own initiative inform their superior if they should recuse themselves from dealing with or if they have a con ict of interest in connection with a matter and conse quently should not take part in considering such matters. 5. freely negotiable shares all orkla shares carry equal rights and are freely negotiable. no special limitations on transactions have been laid down in orkla s articles of association. article 3 second paragraph of the articles of association states that the board of directors may entirely or partly refuse to approve the transfer of shares if the company pursuant to statute or to regulations laid down pursuant to statute is given the discretionary right to refuse such approval or to apply other restrictions on sales. in this connection it should be noted that the provisions of the indus trial licensing act requiring board consent for acquisitions of shares representing more than 20 of all shares in the company are applicable due to orkla s ownership interests in waterfalls. transactions in the orkla share are described in further detail on orkla s website under investor relations. 6. general meetings orkla seeks to ensure that as many shareholders as possible are able to exercise their rights by participating in general meetings ective meeting

law only shares that are registered in the name of the shareholder may be voted. shares that are registered in a nominee account must be reregistered in the vps in order for the shareholder to be able to vote the shares. fur ther information may be found in the notice of the general meeting and on orkla s website. shareholders who are unable to attend the general meet ing may vote by proxy. orkla will appoint the board chair or meeting chair to vote for shareholders. the proxy form is designed in such a way that voting instructions may be given for each item of business that is to be considered. shareholders who were unable to attend the annual general meeting in 2014 could in addition to voting by proxy cast a direct advance vote on the company s website or through vps investor services. the board of directors has decid ed that shareholders may cast such direct advance votes again in 2015. further information regarding use of proxies advance voting and shareholders right to

remuneration of the executive management pursuant to section 6 16a must be sent to all shareholders no later than one week before the general meeting. as authorised by the public limited liability

the meeting if the board in accordance with section 5 8a of the public limited liabil ity companies act has decided that votes at the general meeting may be cast electronically. the decision applies until the annual general meeting in 2015. for the time being there is no satisfactory system for electronic voting at the general meeting and the board of directors therefore does not intend to propose a similar resolution at the 2015 annual general meeting. members of the board of directors are present at general meetings but normally not the entire board has attended. no items of business at general meetings have made this annual report 2014corporate governance necessary to date. the board chair the general manager and the heads of the various business areas are always present in order

is in the process of establishing a standard system for monitoring businesses ehs performance by means of regular ehs audits at all orkla factories while also further developing existing reporting procedures. orkla s board of directors is kept informed of ehs activities through quarterly status reports. orts must be pre ventive. risk assessments are therefore a key element of ehs activities and all units in orkla must carry out such assess ments. the risk analysis serves as the basis for determining which measures to carry out and helps businesses to enhance impr orts by prioritising the most important measur ective action plans. safetyin 2014 few work accidents resulting in very serious injury occurred in orkla s operations. at orkla foods norge s factory at arna a dust explosion took place in connection with the handling of raw materials injuring one person. in addition pro duction equipment was damaged. orkla conducted an internal investigation and several improvement measures were carried out at the factory. moreover lessons learned from the investiga tion were communicated to all orkla factories. the group has also initiated a project to develop training materials on explosion risk to reduce the risk of similar incidents in the future. recording and following up on all types of injuries and undesira ble incidents are an important part of the group s improvement work creating a better understanding and raising awareness of risk throughout the organisation. in 2014 near misses were r orts to prevent injuries must be maintained in every part of the organisation. orkla achieved a lost work day rate number of injuries leading to absence per million hours worked of 7. 2 in 2014 compared with 5. 4 in 2013. 8 the total recordable rate number of injuries leading to absence need for medical treatment or restricted work per million hours was 13. 7 in 2014 compared with 11. 3 in 2013. 8although the number of occupational accidents at orkla is not satisfactory many companies saw a positive trend in 2014. several companies recorded no injuries leading to absence during the year. these results show that improve ments can be achieved by applying key ehs principles such as good order and cleanliness engagement skills upgrad ing and a willingness to learn from others. we will therefore continue to focus on and emphasise the application of these important principles throughout the organisation while also introducing new measures to ensure that further progress is made towards our target of zero injuries. suppliers are monitored on the basis of a risk assessment and orkla s long term goal is to ensure that all orkla suppliers sign the group s supplier code of conduct. as part of the group s due diligence procedures in connection with acquisitions and major investments orkla assesses the risk of becoming involved in breaches of anti corruption and competition law. orkla companies must take necessary risk mitigating action to prevent independent business partners including customers and joint venture partners from partic ipating in corruption or other illegal or unethical activities in connection with its business dealings with orkla. in 2014 orkla was not involved in any cases related to breaches of anti corruption or competition law rules. 6occupational health and safety 7 a safe working environment for all employees contract personnel and suppliers is essential to creating sustainable value. orkla s ambition is to conduct its operations with zero injuries. we ectively working systematically to prevent injuries and work related diseases and actively involving all employees. in line with orkla s decentralised management structure each company has an independent responsibility for its own ehs work. the general requirements with which orkla companies must comply are set out in orkla s ehs policy. in 2014 orkla drew up a common ehs standard and guidelines that apply to every business area and business. the guide lines are designed to ensure compliance and continuous improvement over time. each business must prepare ehs targets and activity plans establish systems and control pro cedures implement measures and report on its ehs activities. the new standard is to be implemented in 2015. are expected to be strongly committed to optimising our ehs performance and all employees are expected to be involved in ehs activities at their workplace. training for all employees is a key factor in the implementation of the new standard and in 2014 train ing materials covering all relevant ehs topics were prepared. orkla has an internal network of ehs experts. collaboration and the transfer of best practices are an important aspect of improvement work and the network will assist in implementing the new group wide principles for ehs work. in 2014 about 6 based on annual internal reporting by the companies. 7 key gures for occupational health and safety comprise all businesses in which orkla owned more than a 50 interest in 2014. 8 9 figures for 2013 have been adjusted in accordance with changes in orkla s corporate structure. 10 compared with the level in 2014. annual report 2014corporate responsibility at orkla occupational healththe sickness absence rate for orkla globally was 4. 4 in 2014 compared with 4. 0 in 2013. 9 there have been minor changes in sickness absence in orkla in the past few years with the same variations during the year. the absence rate is highest in the winter months and lowest in the third quarter. however sickness absence varies signi cantly from country to country and from company to company. the sickness absence rate for the businesses in norway was 5. 7 in 2014. compared with 2013 when the sickness absence rate was 5. 4 there was an increase. the rules for recording sickness absence and following up persons on sick leave vary from one country to another but the sickness absence rate especially in some of the norwegian companies is clearly too high. there is continuous focus on improvement measures. in norway the principles of an inclusive workplace are applied entailing active follow up of persons on sick leave and collaboration with the company health service. in practice this means that individual businesses must put in place good processes in which management and employees are actively involved in establishing measures adapted to their workplace. in 2014 the health professionals in orkla s norwegian busi nesses were organised in a shared company health service. this change enables orkla to make better use of the expertise while also ensuring that the company health service is tailored as far as possible to the needs of the individual companies. orkla seeks to ensure that the principles underpinning health promoting workplaces are applied to the group s operations throughout the world. a health promoting workplace is impor tant for every employee. healthy employees have an in uence on their working environment and are essential to achieving good nancial results. orkla s systematic impr orts focus primarily on preventive measures and rehabilitation. environmentorkla is committed to operating in accordance with sustain able development principles and to reducing the environ mental footprint of its products and processes. in 2014 orkla drew up a general strategy for its long term environmental orts and set the following improvement targets for the group s own production activities up to 2020 10 reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 reduce energy consumption by 20 reduce

in all parts of the value chain is carried out in ac cordance with international norms for human rights working conditions and environmental and anti corruption standards. orkla companies buy a large quantity of raw materials ma terials and services from a total of around 21 000 suppliers. 11 some 2 000 of these are important suppliers. 12 a large part of the orkla companies purchasing takes place locally in the country in which the business is located. around 60 of the group s purchases come from suppliers in the nordic and the baltic regions which are orkla s main markets. 11 in 2009 orkla drew up a policy for responsible sourcing that must be adhered to by all the group companies. work is to be based on three main principles 1 communication of orkla s ethical standards to suppliers 2 identi cation of the risk of breaches of these standards and 3 follow up of risky suppliers through dialogue audits and guidance. a total of 23 companies have implemented or are implementing the procedures for risk identi cation and supplier monitoring. these companies account for a total of around 85 of orkla s sourcing. 11 orts to promote responsible sourcing is reviewed annually by the group executive board through business area reviews. orkla s supplier code of conduct orkla s supplier code of conduct describes the require ments set for suppliers by the group with regard to human rights workers rights and social conditions environmental orts. these require ments are based on relevant un and ilo conventions. they were revised in 2012 in collaboration with the ethical trading initiative norway ieh and are in conformity with ieh ethical trade guidelines. the supplier code of conduct is appended to orkla s standard supplier agreement. risk identi cation the large number of orkla suppliers makes it important to give priority to monitoring the suppliers and raw material chains considered to be the most risky. to identify risky suppli ers orkla companies carry out a rough risk assessment of their supplier portfolio. the assessment is based on known risk factors related to countries industries and production processes. all suppliers of raw materials and packaging and other important suppliers have been subjected to this type of general risk assessment. new suppliers are also routinely subjected to a general risk assessment and are required to accept orkla s supplier code of conduct. in the case of potentially risky suppliers a more detailed risk assessment must be carried out. the suppliers are asked to conduct a self evaluation based on a standardised method 11 concerns orkla s branded consumer goods area. 12 important suppliers are suppliers with multiple deliveries and a purchasing value in 2014 in excess of nok 500 000. orts to develop more environ mentally friendly packaging and reduce the environmental footprint of its products. any emissions or discharges that may be generated by orkla s businesses are recorded and dealt with in compliance with national and local requirements. in 2014 orkla had one emissions incident which was caused by an error at the water treatment plant at lilleborg s detergents factory at ski and entailed a ne of around nok 30 000. otherwise four minor regulatory breaches were recorded which did not result in a ne. action was taken to remedy all of these issues. orkla s impact on the environment consists primarily of emissions generated in connection with energy use and transport. use of materials and scarce natural resources including water are also important focus areas that must be considered in relation to the entire value chain and products life cycle. at the local level factories waste management and noise abatement measures are key areas of activity. several orkla businesses work systematically to map their energy consumption and explore possibilities for rational ciency improvement and investment projects are carried out each year to reduce energy con sumption and increase energy recovery. energy consumption in 2014 totalled 850 gwh compared with 832 gwh in 2013. 9 around 400 gwh of this was pur chased energy. the change in energy consumption was 2. 2. a total of 2. 571 gwh was produced by orkla s own hydropower plants in norway. for several years orkla has prepared energy and climate ac counts based on the international greenhouse gas protocol initiative. these accounts are also reported to the carbon disclosure project cdp an independent organisation that provides investors worldwide with a basis for assessing how the world s largest companies are responding to climate challenges. in 2014 greenhouse gas emissions from orkla s own global operations totalled 102 000 tonnes of co 2 equivalents compared with corresponding emissions in 2013 of 100 000 tonnes. these emissions are primarily generated by the production of thermal energy from fossil fuels at facto ries. if emissions from purchased energy are included total emissions for 2014 amount to approx. 165 000 tonnes of co2 equivalents compared with 168 000 tonnes in 2013. 9 annual report 2014corporate responsibility at orkla developed by the sedex organisation. at the end of 2014 a total of 228 orkla suppliers were registered in sedex which constitutes around 80 of the suppliers classi ed as risky i. e. there is a high risk that the supplier will not adhere to orkla s supplier code of conduct. orkla companies monitor potentially risky suppliers by engaging in dialogue carrying out audits and providing guidance. an ethical audit is conducted in cases where the company perceives a need for a more detailed independent examination of the supplier s procedures and practices with regard to working conditions health and workplace safety protection of the external environment and anti corruption orts. all audits are summed up in a non conformity report and improvement plan and the supplier must undertake to remedy the identi ed non conformities within an agreed period of time. a total of 48 ethical supplier audits of orkla suppliers were carried out in the period 2013 2014. the process of auditing risky suppliers has taken longer than anticipated and will continue in 2015. the aim is to complete audits of all risky suppliers by the end of 2015. improvement workin the period 2013 2014 222 non conformities were detected in supplier audits. the most common non conformities are the lack of adequate personal protective equipment inadequate re safety rst aid and noise protection procedures excessive use of overtime and non conformities related to wages and overtime compensation. a total of 206 non conformities were corrected and the remainder will be addressed in 2015. orkla is a member of the ethical trading initiative norway and aim progress the european branded goods platform for responsible sourcing. both these organisations hold courses for suppliers in risky countries and industries and er their suppliers the opportunity to participate in these courses. orkla companies are involved in certain raw material supply chains that present complex challenges. the most important chains in terms of purchasing volumes are cocoa palm oil sh and seafood vegetables fruit and berries and nuts and seeds. the production of these raw materials can give rise to serious challenges in terms of poverty child labour breaches of labour standards unsustainable cultivation and shing methods reduction of species diversity greenhouse gas emissions and con icts over land ownership rights. several of the companies are engaged in improvement projects related to cocoa palm oil sh and seafood vegetables and fruit and berries. these projects include use of certi cation systems participation in industry initiatives and collaborative projects in which the companies public authorities and expert organisations are involved. in 2014 orkla drew up goals and main measures for work with these raw material categories up to 2020. moreover orkla de ned general goals and main measures for future work with the group s contract producers and began the process of identifying challenges and necessary actions in the packaging supply chain. the overarching goal for responsible sourcing in the next ve year period is to ensure that the production of important agricultural products marine raw materials and packaging is carried out in accordance with orkla s sustainability principles. training in 2010 orkla etablished an internal network for responsible sourcing which includes members of the companies sour s. the network is headed by orkla s central sourcing department and is used for training and experience sharing purposes. responsible sourcing is also a topic addressed in orkla s leadership development programme and in the group s training programme for sourc ing marketing and sales. in 2014 a total of 894 hours of training were provided for 98 managers and employees. the corre sponding gures for the previous year were 845 hours of training for 82 employees. training programmes and exchanges of experience will continue in 2015 with emphasis on providing in depth knowledge of orkla s responsible sourcing

including notes for the year 2014 were approved by the board of directors of orkla asa on 4 february 2015. orkla asa is a public limited companyes are located in nedre sk yen vei 26 oslo in norway. the company s shares are traded on the oslo stock exchange. the orkla group operates primarily in the branded consumer goods and renewable energy sectors as well as in aluminium solutions through its ownership interests in sapa jv 50 and gr nges 31 . the business areas are described in note 4 and in segment information for the various business areas which is disclosed in note 8. the nancial statements for 2014 have been prepared and presented in full compliance with the international financial reporting standards ifrs as adopted by the eu. the valuation and recognition of the items in the nancial statements have been carried out in accordance with applicable ifrs standards. the most important principles are described below. in the 2014 nancial year the iasb made no changes that haveect on orkla s nancial statements. in 2013 orkla took the opportunity to early adopt a num ber of standards that became mandatory from 1 january 2014. the standards in question were ifrs 10 consolidated financial statements ifrs 11 joint arrangements and ifrs 12 disclosure of interests in other entities. in addition ifrs 13 fair value measurement and amendments to ias 19 employee bene ts were adopted as from 1 january 2013. the introduction of the new standards also entailed changes in ias 27 revised separate financial statements and ias 28 revised investments in associates and joint ventures. a minor change has also been made in ias 32 assets and financial liabilities. ects of the changes with regard to pensions ias 19 and joint ventures ifrs 11 are described in the corresponding note for 2013. orkla also took the opportunity to early adopt ifrs 13 which required disclosures regarding value in use per cash generating unit in impairment calculations. this requirement was removed through the amendment to ias 36. the other standards haveect on orkla s consolidated nancial statements. gr nges underwent an ipo process and the company was listed on the stock exchange on 10 october 2014. gr nges is therefore presented as discontinued operations. the comparative gures in the income statement ha ve been restated. historical gures for the statement of nancial position and the cash ow statement have not been restated. the sale of gr nges was reported as a 100 sale even though orkla sold only 69 of the company. as contra entry the remaining 31 will be reported as an investment in an associate and recognised using the equity method from the fourth quarter of 2014. the value of the shareholding is based on the market value on 10 october 2014 see note 7. it was decided to wind up the orkla international segment and the operations in vitana czech republic felix austria and mtr india have been moved to the orkla foods segment. the delecta business was sold in the third quarter of 2014. figures reported until the sale took place are included in orkla foods. chaka have been moved to orkla confectionery snacks. orkla will continue to seek structural solutions for chaka. orkla brands russia obr has been sold and all approvals from the russian competition authorities have been received. this means that the group has in fact exited the geographical area russia and the operations in obr thereby qualify for classi cation as discontinued operations. obr is thus presented on a single line as discontinued operations and comparative gures in the income statement have been restated in the same way as for gr nges. historical gures for the statement of nancial position and cash ow statement have not been restated. the group has not otherwise changed the presentation or accounting principles or applied new standards that signi cantlyect its nancial reporting or the comparison with previous periods. the most important principles are described in note 4. rieber s n the purchase price allocation carried out after the acquisition of rieber s n has been nalised. some adjustments were made in the valuation of the rieber companies in eastern europe in relation to the preliminary purchase price allocation. the valuation of delecta in poland has been con rmed through a sale process while the assumptions for the two other companies vitana and chaka have been changed. the goodwill allocated to the latter companies has been r eallocated to orkla foods. the value of the property in arna the toro factory has increased somewhat since the preliminary purchase price allocation. all in all therefore the total level of goodwill has been reduced slightly and the allocation has been changed marginally. new acquisitions orkla confectionery snacks has entered into an agreement with nordic partners food limited to purchase np foods group. this acquisition will close to double the scope of orkla s baltic operations making orkla one of the largest suppliers of branded consumer goods to the baltic grocery sector see note 39. orkla home personal has signed an agreement to purchase the branded consumer goods company cederroth. the acquisition of cederroth will make orkla home personal one of the nordic region s leading suppliers of personal care health wound care and household cleaning products see note 39. the two acquisitions have not yet been approved by the competition authorities. for other smaller acquisitions that have been completed or purchase agreements entered into see note 6 and note 39. other income and expenses oie other income and expenses are presented after group pro t loss ebit adj. broken down by segment and include items of a special nature. m a costs are costs relating to the acquisition of companies which cannot be capitalised together with the shares. this applies to both completed and uncompleted acquisitions. accrued expenses arising from the sale of companies are also presented on this line until the sale is nally completed. at that time the selling costs will be included in the pro t loss calculation and will be presented together with the latterects include such items as the recognition in the income statement of fair value ascribed to inventories in acquired companies and any impacts on value of the acquisition of additional shares in partly owned companies. in addition to the description in note 13 the following matters require comment ontractual termination fee of nok 279 million related to the unilever agreement has been taken to income. the previous agreement with unilever which dated back to 1958 and was last revised in 2009 expired on 30 june 2014. a new agreement has been signed ect from 1 july 2014 and will run for a period of ve years. the agreement provides for a licence for research and development and for deliveries of nished products from unilever. the parties have also agreed that lilleborg s licence for the brands owned by unilever in norway is to terminate as from january 2016 after which unilever itself will distribute the brands. this is expected to result in a reduction in annual turnover for lilleborg of around nok 100 million which represents around 2 of orkla home personal s total turnover. as compensation for the termination of the licences orkla will receive a cee. this will be paid towards the end of the second quarter of 2015. a complete set of financial statements consists of an income statement a statement of financial position a statement of cash flows a statement of changes in equity and notes. the notes are intended to provide supplementary information on items in the four aforementioned statements and backg round information on the way the financial statements have been prepared. such information includes for instance the segments for which the financial statemen ts have been prepared and presented any circumstances which may have a particular effect on the financial statements the general principles on which the financial statements are based and any sources of estimate uncertainty that may apply to the statements. the notes also disclose any accounting matters that will affect the grou p in the future especially in the form of new framework conditions issued by the international accounting standard board. annual report 2014notes group accounting principles costs related to the further integration and coordination of the rieber operations totalling nok 118 million as at 31 december 2014 have been expensed. the costs are related to the closure of the lierne plant coordination of the external sales function and the redesign of the toro factory at arna outside bergen as well as to a project related to the factory at elverum. furthermore production of herring was moved from boyfood in finland to kungshamn in sworm of equip ment write downs and the award of severance packages. additional costs were incurred in connection with the integration and coordination of operations in orkla foods. in total orkla foods has expensed nok 146 million related to these matters under other income and expenses as at 31 december 2014. costs totalling nok 39 million as at 31 december 2014 were incurred in connection with the further coordination and restructuring of operations in confectionery snacks including factory operations at kung lv and filipstad in sweden. the costs are related to both severance packages and consultancy fees. m a costs totalling nok 12 million were also incurred. orkla home personal incurred restructuring costs and costs related to the downsizing of the external sales force totalling nok 39 million. m a costs of nok 5 million were also incurred. the remaining other income and expenses consist of costs related to m a integration severance packages and an ongoing brand dispute. other matters orkla is still exposed to the weak markets in southern europe through the activities of its joint venture sapa jv. although sapa s performancect the group s ordinaryect is seen on the line for pro t loss from associates and joint ventures. orkla has largely switched to de ned contribution pension plans and it is primarily the businesses in sweden that still have de ned bene t plans. the contractual early retirement scheme is accounted for as a de ned contribution plan. orkla has no loan agreements containing nancial covenants. impairment tests that have been carried out con rm that the capitalised value as at ember 2014 of the group s most exposed assets is intact see note 17. note 2 basis for preparation of the consolidated financial statements to understand the financial statements it is essential that the basic principles for both financial recognition and consolidation of the group are described. similarly the use of parantheses and the currency in which the financial statements are presented will be significant. the nancial statements are primarily based on the historical cost principle. however this does not apply to the treatment of nancial assets which are mainly reported at fair value as available for sale or with changes in value reported in pro t or loss. the ect of these principles will be less and less signi cant for the group as the share portf. cash ow hedges that satisfy the criteria for hedge accounting are also reported at fair value in the statement of nancial position and changes in value are recognised in comprehensive income. assets that no longer justify their value are written down to the re coverable amount which is the higher of value in use and fair value minus selling costs. the accrual accounting principle and the going concern assumption are underlying assumptions for preparing the nancial statements. an asset or liability is classi ed as current when it is part of a normal operating cycle when it is held primarily for trading purposes when it falls due within 12 months or when it consists of cash or cash equivalents on the statement of nancial position date. other items are non current. a dividend does not become a liability until it has been formally approved by the general meeting. discontinued operations and assets held for sale are presented on separate lines as current items see separate description. financial instruments held to maturity are included in nancial non current assets unless the redemption date is within 12 months after the statement of nancial position date. the amortisation of intangible assets and the above mentioned other income and expenses are presented on separate lines. the amortisation of intangible assets will essentially consist of the cost accrual over useful life of intangible assets related to acquired companies in orkla food ingredients. all amounts are in nok million unless otherwise stated. figures in parantheses are expenses or disbursements cash ow. the functional currency of the parent company a is nok and the group s reporting currency is nok. the information in italics preceding the income statement statement of nancial position statement of cash ows and notes is provided to give a more detailed explanation of the various presentations. consolidation principles the consolidated nancial statements show the ove rall nancial results and the overall nancial position when the parent company orkla asa and its controlling interests in other companies are presented as a single economic entity. all the companies have applied consistent principles and all interc ompany matters have been eliminated. interests in companies in which the group alone has controlling interest subsidiaries have been fully consolidated line by line in the consolidated nancial statements from the date the group has control and are consolidated until the date that such control ends. the determining factor for whether an enterprise is to be consolidated is whether the group is deemed to have control. the group will have control if it has the power to govern the nancial and operating policies of the subsidiary has exposure or rights to variable returns from the subsidiary and has the ability to use its power over the subsidi aryect the amount of its returns. if the group has control but owns less than 100 of the subsidiaries the non controlling interests share of pro t or loss after tax and their share of equity are presented on separate lines. as at 31 december 2014 no companies were consolidated in the group based on the rules regarding de facto control. interests in companies in which the group together with others has controlling interest joint ventures note 7 are valued using the equity method. the main company in this category is sapa jv in which orkla owns 50 while the remaining 50 is owned by norsk hydro see note 7. orkla has another joint venture moss airport rygge 40 . interests in companies over which the group has signi cant in uence associates note 7 are also valued using the equity method. this applies to companies in which the group owns an interest of between 20 and 50. orkla s most important associates are jotun in which the group has a 42. 5 interest and gr nges in which it has a 31 interest. shares and nancial assets are dealt with in a separate section below. a decision has been made to divest the share portfolio and the value of the remaining portfolio was nok 734 million as at 31 december 2014. other smaller nancial investments have been treated as available for sale and recognised in the statement of nancial position at fair value with changes in value taken to comprehensive income. note 3 new accounting standards accounting is constantly evolving and changes in rules can result in significant differences in accounting practices. it is therefore important to provide an adequate overview of the standards that are currently being developed and the impact that they may have on the future preparation and presentation of financial statements. new and amended iasb accounting standards that have been approved by the eu can ect the preparation and presentation of nancial statements to varying degrees. no new standards issued by iasb were implemented in 2014 that have had any material impact on the orkla group s nancial statements see the information in note 1. future changes in standards the consolidated nancial statements ected by ifrs amendments in the future. the iasb is working on several projects the most important of which are recognition of income leasing financial instruments and insurance contracts. these projects will not be implemented for some time. ifrs 15 recognition of income was published in may 2014 and will come into force on 1 january 2017 while ifrs 9 financial instruments was published in june 2014 and will come into force on 1 january 2018. according to orkla s understanding of the application of the new standards they will not have a material impact on the group. a nal analysis of the consequences of annual report 2014accounting principles notes group has not yet been completed. ifrs 9 may entail that more nancial hedging relationships must be re ected in the nancial statements for the orkla group. ifrs 9 mayect pro t loss for and the classi cation of certain share investments which are currently recognised as available for the share portfolio these changes are expected to be immaterial at the time they enter into force. orkla expects to implement the standards when they enter into force provided they have been approved by the eu. note 4 key accounting principles this note elaborates on the basic principles applied and describes the way that individual items in the financial statements are treated. all the principles are consistent with current ifrs but choices interpretations and adaptations must nonetheless be made which affect the preparation and presentation of financial statements to varying degrees. business combinations business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. when a subsidiary is acquired a purchase price allocation is carried out. assets and liabilities are valued at their fair value at the time of acquisition. the residual value in the acquisition will be goodwill. the acquisition is reported in the nancial statements from the date the group has control. the date of control is normally the date on which the acquisition agreement takect and has been approved by all the relevant authorities and will normally be after the contract date. if there are non controlling interests in the acquired company these will receive their share of allocated assets and liabilities. transactions with the non controlling interests will be recognised in equity. in companies where the group already owned interests prior to the business combination any change in the value of earlier interests will be recognised in the income statement. the group s equity will thereforected by the fact that the assets are repriced as if the entire acquisition had been made at this time. the same procedure will in principle be carried out in connection with the establishment of a joint venture and with the acquisition of an associate. however these are not considered to be business combinations because the group does not obtain control. sale of companies when a business is divested the gain is measurerence between the selling price and book equity minus any remaining excess value related to the business. any sales expenses incurred will also reduce the gain increase the loss. accumulated erences related to the divested business will be recognised in pro t or loss as part of the gain with a corresponding contra entry in comprehensive income and any hedging reserves are recognised in pro t or loss. sales expenses incurred will be reported as other income and expenses m a in the period prior to the agreement date and will be recognised as a part of the gain upon completion of the agreement. the gain will be reported before tax and the business s associated tax will be recognised on the tax line of the income statement. the real gain is re ected in the sum total of the gain and the tax. if the sold business quali es for recognition as discontinued operations ects associated with the gain will be reported on the line for discontinued operations in the income statement. discontinued operations held for sale if a material part of the group s operations is divested an agreement is made to divest it or if the group loses its controlling interest signi cant in uence these operations are presented as discontinued operations on a separate line in the income statement and the statement of nancial position. a material part is de ned as a separate segment a separate geographical area or a signi c ant asset. consequently all other gures are presented exclusive of the discontinued operations. the comparative gures in the income statement are restated and presented with the discontinued operations on one line. the comparative gures for the statement of nancial position and the state ment of cash ows are not restated correspondingly. if an agreement is entered into to sell operations or assets that constitute less than a segment assets and liabilities are reported on separate lines of the statement of nancial position as held for sale. the income statement and the statement of cash ows are not restated. equity method investments in associates are investments in companies in which the orkla group has signi cant in uence by virtue of its ownership interest. these are usually companies in which orkla owns a 20 50 stake. joint ventures are investments in companies where the group together with others has controlling interest. this applies to companies where the group has entered into an agreement with another party to operate and develop a joint company in which neither of the parties alone has control. both these types of investment are accounted for under the equity method by the group presenting its share of the companies results after tax and non controlling interests on a separate line in the income statement and accumulating the results reported for the share on a single line in the statement of nancial position. any excess value that is to be amortised is deducted from pro t according to the same principles as for consolidated companies. goodwill is not amortised. dividends received from associates and joint ventures are reported against the ownership interest in the statement of nancial position and are regarded as repayment of capital. the value of associates and joint ventures presented in the statement of nancial position thus represents the original cost price plus pro t loss accumulated up to the present date minus any amortisation of excess value and accumulated dividends received. account is also taken of the share of any translation erences and the like in the associate or joint venture. any write downs of the value of the ownership interest are presented on the same line. joint ventures were previously reported using the proportionate consolidation method. the group accounted for its involvement in the joint venture by including its proportionate share of revenues expenses assets liabilities and cash ows in its consolidated nancial statements. since implementation of the new ifrs 11 in 2013 the proportionate consolidation method is no longer permitted and joint ventures must be accounted for using the equity method. comparative gures have been restated accordingly. pro t loss revenue is recognised when it is probable that transactions will generate future economic bene t that will ow to the company and the amount of the revenue can be measured with reliability. sales revenues are presented after deducting discounts value added tax and other government charges and taxes. the orkla group sells goods and services on manyerent markets and revenues from the sale of goods or services are recognised in the income statement when the goods have been delivered or the service has been provided. generally speaking the group s operating revenues and the point in time at which they are recognised in income will be clear in most cases. sales of goods produced by the group and merchandise for resale by the branded consumer goods area are recognised in income when the goods have been delivered and the risk has passed to the buyer. sales revenues largely consist of sales of consumer goods to wholesalers. reductions in sales revenues include various bonus plans discounts and assistance related to joint marketing to customers in addition to special taxes applicable to food production and other public charges. external sales of electric power are recognised in income on the basis of the price agreed with the customer upon delivery. electric power is mainly sold by the saudefaldene and sarpsfoss plants. in orkla investments real estate rental revenues are recognised in income when they are earned. remuneration related to sales assignments for which the company has pro t and loss responsibility is recognised in income upon delivery. this means that a long period of time may elapse between the start of a building project and the recognition of revenues. in the intervening period incurred project expenses are reported as inventories. interest revenues are recognised when they are earned while dividends are taken to income on the date they are approved by the company paying out the dividend. gains losses on shares and interests that have been reported as available for sale are presented on a separate line after oper ating pro t loss. gains losses on shares and interests that have been reported as available fo r sale arerence between the cost price of the share or if appropriate the value of the share or interest written down for accounting purposes and the sales value. any excess value or shortfall in market value that has temporarily been taken to comprehensive income is reversed at the same time. ect of portfolio gains losses will be signi cantly reduced as the share portf. statement of comprehensive income the statement of comprehensive income presents items that are recognised in equity but are not included in ordinary pro t or loss for the period. the items in the statement are actuarial gains and losses on pensions changes in hedging reserves in hedging transactions changes in unrealised gains or losses on investments in shares and currencyects. actuarial gains and losses on pensions are recognised in annual report 2014equity ect while the other items are recognised in equity temporarily and reversed when the related assets items are sold or settled. corresponding items in associates and joint ventures are reported in the same way. assetsproperty plant and equipment are tangible items intended for production delivery of goods or administrative purposes and have a lasting useful life. they are recognised in the statement of nancial position at cost minus any accumulated depreciation and write downs. direct maintenance of assets is expensed under operating expenses as and when the maintenance is carried out while major periodical maintenance and expenditure on replacements or improvements are added to the cost price of the assets. property plant and equipment with an inde nite useful life property etc. are not depreciated while other property plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis over their useful life. residual value is taken into account and the depreciation plan is reviewed annually. if there is any indication that an asset may be impaired the asset will be written down to the re coverable amount if the re coverable amount is lower than the carrying value. when carrying out a purchase price allocation in connection with an acquisition excess or de cit values are allocated to the assets concerned so that these are recognised in the statement of nancial position at the group s acquisition cost. financing expenses related to the production of the group s own property plant and equipment are recognised in the statement of nancial position see note 14. intangible assets. research and development r d expenditure is the expenses incurred by the group in conducting research and development studies of existing or new products production processes etc. in order to secure future earnings. expenditure on research will always be expensed directly while expenditure on development will be recognised in the statement of nancial position if the underlying economic factors are identi able and represent probable future economic bene ts of which the group has control. the group has a large number of projects under consideration at all times but for the time being no projects that end in capitalisation apart from the it development described below. this is due to the considerable uncertainty throughout the decision making process and the fact that only a small percentage of all projects culminate in commercial products. furthermore the expenses that qualify for recognition in the statement of nancial position are relatively small as it is only from the time the decision to develop the product is made that development expenses can be capitalised and that decision making point comes at a late stage of the process see note 18. capitalised expenditure on internally generated or customised computer programmes is presented as intangible assets. the reinvestment need of customised computer programmes etc. is similar to that of other tangible assets and the amortisation of this type of intangible asset is presented together with the group s other depreciation. expenditure related to internally gener ated trademarks etc. marketing is expensed directly since the future economic bene ts to the company cannot be identi ed and shown to be probable with any degree of certainty at the time the trademark is launched. intangible assets taken over by the company through acquisitions are capitalised. orkla has drawn up special guidelines for valuing trademarks taken over through acquisitions. trademarks that have existed for a long period of time and have a sound development at the time of acquisition have an inde nite useful life and are not amortised. an inde nite useful life means that it is impossible on the statement of nancial position date to estimate the period during which assets will be available for use. other identi ed trade marks will be amortised over their anticipated useful life which is normally 5 10 years. other intangible assets will be amortised over their useful life. intangible assets with an inde nite useful life must be tested annually for impairment to assess whether the values are re coverable. the orkla group carries out this test prior to preparing and presenting its nancial statements for the third quarter. if there are indi cations of impairment the assets are tested immediately. a new impairment test is carried out in the fourth quarter when necessary for instance if the underlying assumptions have changed. such impairment tests are described in note 17. intangible assets arising from new acquisitions are disclosed in note 6 and note 18. goodwill is the residual value consisting oference between the purchase price and the capitalised value of an acquired company after a purchase price allocation has been carried out. the concept of goodwill comprises payment for expectations of synergy gains assets related to employees other intangible assets that do not qualify for capitalisation as a separate item future superpro t and the fact that deferred tax may not be discounted. capitalised goodwill derives solely from acquisitions. goodwill is not amortised but is tested at least once a year for impairment prior to preparing and presenting the nancial statements for the third quarter and if there is any indication of a decline in value. new goodwill is disclosed in note 6 and note 18. inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value for the entire orkla group. purchased goods are valued at cost according to the fifo principle while internally manufactured nished goods and work in progress are valued at production cost. deductions are made for obsolescence. net realisable value is the estimated selling price minus selling costs. inventories also include ongoing real estate projects. accounts receivable are recognised and presented at the original invoice amount and written down if events causing a loss have occurred that can be measured reliably and that ect payment of the receivable. trade receivables are thus valued at amortised cective interest rate method. the interest rate element is disregarded if it is immaterial which is the case for the vast majority of the group s trade receivables. shares and nancial assets. the remaining shares and nancial assets are investments of a nancial nature and are presented at fair value as a current asset. shareholdings de ned as available for sale which have a value lower than carrying value are written down in the income statement if the impairment in value is prolonged or signi cant. any further value impairment will result in an immediate write down. the write down cannot be reversed in the income statement until the value is realised. dividends received are recognised in the income statement at the time they are adopted by the company paying out the dividend which usually coincides with the time of payment. purchases and sales of shares are recognised at trade date see note 23. cash and cash equivalents are held for the purpose of meeting short term uctuations in liquidity rather than for investment purposes. cash and cash equivalents consist of cash bank deposits and current deposits which satisfy the criteria for cash equivalents. for orkla the level of the group s net interest bearing liabilities is a more important management parameter than the level of cash and cash equivalents. equity debt and liabilities treasury shares are reported in equity at the cost price to the group. pensions. the group mainly has de ned contribution pension plans but also has some de ned bene t pension plans primarily in sweden and norway. in the de ned contribution pension plans the company is responsible for making an agreed contribution to the employee s pension assets. the future pension will be determined by the amount of the contributions and the return on the pension savings. once the contributions have been paid there are no further payment obligations attached to the de ned contribution pension i. e. there is no liability to record in the statement of nancial position. the pension costs related to de ned contribution plans will be equal to the contributions to employees pension savings in the reporting period. de ned bene t pension plans are based on a promise by the company to the employees that they will receive a certain level of pension upon retirement normally de ned as a percentage of nal pay. the company is responsible for the amount of the future pension bene t and the nancial value of this obligation must be reported in the income statement and statement of nancial position. the accrued liability is calculated on a straight line accruals basis and is measured as the present value of the estimated future pension payments that are vested on the statement of nancial position date. the capitalised net liability is the sum of the accrued pension liability minus the fair value of associated pension fund assets. changes in the liability for de ned bene t plans due to changes in pension plans are reported in their entirety in the income statement in the case of changes that give rise to an immediate paid up policy entitlement. orkla s pension plan for employees in norway for employees who earn more than twelve times the norwegian national insurance scheme s basic amount 12g is a contribution based plan. since the sum of the accrued contributions and the return on the plan assets is reported as a pension liability in the company s statement of nancial position this pension plan is presented as a de ned bene t plan. notes group accounting principles annual report 2014since 2013 the revised ias 19 standard has been applied for the group s pension plans. actuarial gains and losses are recognised in equity through the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. the nancial part of net pension expense is presented as a nancial item rather than as part of the net pension expense in ebit adj. . this means that interest on pension obligations and expected return on pension plan assets are reported as nancial items. contingent liabilities and contingent assets. a contingent liability or asset is a possible obligation or a possible asset whose existence is uncertain and will be con rmed by the occurrence or non occurrence of a future special event such as the outcome of legal proceedings or the nal settlement of an insurance claim. contingent liabilities are recognised in the nancial statements based on estimated outcome if there is a more than 50 probability that the liability has arisen. if the probability is lower the matter is disclosed in notes to the nancial statements unless the probability of disbursement is very small. an asset will only be recognised in the statement of nancial position if it is highly probable 95 that the group will receive the asset. the disclosure requirement applies to other contingent assets. income tax. current tax liabilities assets for the current and previous periods are measured at the amount that is expected to be paid to re covered fr om the tax authorities. tax rates and tax laws used to calculate the amounts are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in the countries in which the group operates and generates taxable income. current income tax relating to items recognised through the statement of comprehensive income is recognised through the statement of comprehensive income and not in the income statement. deferred tax liabilities assets are computed by using the liability method for all temporaryerences between the tax basis and the carrying amount of an asset or liability at the reporting date including tax losses carried forward. deferred tax liabilities assets are not recognised for temporaryerences associated with investments in subsidiaries associates and interests in joint ventures when the timing of the reversal of the temporaryerences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporaryerences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. deferred tax liabilities assets are not recognised for the initial recognition of goodwill either. deferred tax liabilities are recognised on retained pro ts in associates joint ventures and foreign subsidiaries to the extent it is expected that a dividend will be paid in the foreseeable future. deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that there will be available taxable income against which the deductible temporaryerences and unused tax losses can be applied. deferred tax that concerns items recognised through the statement of comprehensive income is recognised through the statement of comprehensive income and not in the income statement. deferred assets and liabilities are measured at the nominal tax rates expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled. the assessment is thereby based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets are only reported net to the extent that netting is permitted under the tax rules and the group is capable of and intends to settle its assets and liabilities related to current tax using group contributions. financial matters foreign currency. transactions in foreign currencies are recognised at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. financial receivables and liabilities in foreign currencies are presented at the exchange rate on the statement of nancial position date and any gain loss is reported in the income statement as nancial items. other monetary items e. g. accounts receivable and accounts payable in a foreign currency are presented at the exchange rate on the statement of nancial position date and any gain loss is reported in the income statement as operating items. revenues and expenses in subsidiaries erent functional currency from that of the parent company are translated monthly at the average exchange ra te for the month and accumulated. state ment of nancial position items in subsidiaries erent functional currency are translated at the exchange rate on the statement of nancial position date. translation erences are reported in comprehensive income. trerences arising from borrowing and lending in another functional currency identi ed as net investment are also reported in comprehensive income. derivatives are valued at fair value on the statement of nancial position date and reported as receivables or liabilities. gains and losses due to realisation or changes in fair value are reported in the income statement in cases where the derivative is not part of a hedge relationship that satis es the criteria for hedge accounting. embedded

instrument 1 the hedging instrument is expected to be highlyectiv value or cash ows to an identi ed ectiveness is expected to be between 80 125 2 the hedging ectiveness can be measured reliably 3 satisfactory documentation is established before entering into the hedging instrument showing among other things that the hedging rective 4 in the case of cash ow hedges that the future transaction is considered to be probable and 5 the hedging relationship is evaluated regularly and has provective. fair value hedging. changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedging instruments are immediately recognised in income. changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recognised in income in the same way. hedge accounting is discontinued if a the hedging instrument has matured or is terminated exercised or sold b the hedge no longer satis es the above mentioned criteria for hedging or c the group for other reasons decides not to continue the fair value hedge. in the case of a discontinued hedge relationship the changes in the fair value of the hedged item recognised in the statement of nancial position will be amortised over the remaining life ofective interest rate method in the same way as for the hedging instrument. cash ow hedges. changes in the fair value of a hedging instrument is recognised in comprehensive income and reclassi ed to the income statement when the hedged transaction is carried out and presented on the same line as the hedged transaction. the hedging instrument is immediately recognised in the income statement. when a hedging instrument has matured or is sold terminated or exercised or the group discontinues the hedging relationship even though the hedged transaction is still expected to occur the accumulated gains or losses at this point will remain in the group s hedging reserve and will be recognised in the income statement when the transaction occurs. if the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur the accumulated unrealised gains or losses on the hedging instrument will be recognised in the income statement immediately. hedges of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. currency gains or losses on hedging the hedging relationship are reported in comprehensive income while currency gains or the hedge are reported in the income statement. measurement of nancial instruments. the group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of nancial instruments see note 23 level 1 quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities level 2 other techniques for which all inputs which haveect on the recorded fair value are observable either directly or indirectly accounting principles notes group annual report 2014level 3 other techniques which use inputs that haveect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data. listed shares are considered to be in level 1 as the shares are quoted on stock exchanges and are freely traded and measured at the latest stock market price. shares in the solsten fund are considered to be in level 2 as the value of the shares is mainly determined on the basis of securities traded in an active market. unlisted shares are considered to be in level 3. derivatives are considered to be in level 2. the foreign exchange element in currency forward contracts is measured at observable market prices using the foreign exchange rate set by norerent maturity dates add an interest r ate element resulting in an estimated fair value of the currency forward contracts.

leases are classi ed according to the extent to which the risks and rewards associated with ownership of a leased asset lie with the lessor or the lessee. a lease is classi ed as a nance lease if it substantially transfers all risks and rewards incidental notes group accounting principles annual report 2014to ownership of an asset. finance leases are capitalised and depreciated over the lease period. other leases are operating leases. expenses related to such leases are reported as current operating expenses see note 35. share based remuneration. the group has share savings programmes long term incentive agreements and share options. the sale of shares to employees at a price lower than the market value is accounted for by recerence between the market value of the shares and the purchase price as a payroll expense. the discount ered in connection with the sale of shares to employees remained unchanged in 2014 at 30. the option programme for executive management was replaced in 2012 by a long term incentive lti agreement. an amount equivalent to what was paid out in annual bonuses is deposited in a bonus bank for bonus recipients. the amounts are adjusted in accordance with the price performance of the orkla share and fall due for payment in two equal halves two and three years respectively after the bonus is awarded. in order to be eligible for the bonus the recipient must be employed at the time the bonus is paid out. no new options have been awarded since 2012. the former option programme for executive management was valued on the basis of the fair value of the option at the time the option programme was adopted the award date using the black scholes model. the cost of the option was accrued over the period during which the employee earned the right to receive it the vesting period. the option costs are recognised as payr. provisions are made for the employer s social security contributions in connection with share option programmes which are rerence between the issue price and the market price of the share at year end. option costs are broken down by operating segment based on the fair value of the options at the date of issue including employer s national insurance contribution and accrued over the vesting period see note 5 in the nancial statements for orkla asa. government grants are recognised in the nancial statements when it is highly probable that they will be received. the grants are presented either as revenue or as a reduction in costs and in the latter case matched with the costs for which they are intended to compensate. government grants that relate to assets are recognised as a reduction in the acquisition cost of the asset. the grant reduces the depreciation of the asset see note 39. note 5 use of estimates in preparing the consolidated financial statements the preparation of financial statements entails that the executive management must make decisions on the closing date on the basis of the information and discretionary assessments available on the date in question. this may apply to estimates and assumptions relating to financial statement items or other matters that may also have a material influence on the valuation of the company. it is important that the financial statement user is aware of these different items and the valuation techniques used to determine the values in the financial statements. any material change in value up until the time the board of directors presents its report must be reflected in either the financial statements or in the notes. the management has made use of estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated nancial statements. this applies to assets liabilities revenues expenses and supplementary information related to contingent liabilities. fair value assessments arected by estimates of required rates of return. the required rate of return is determined byected by estimates of risk free interest and risk premium. areas where estimates will have greatest signi cance in orkla are amounts in nok million accounting itemnoteestimate assumptions carrying value goodwill17 18net present value future cash ows nsv 110 291trademarks

material changes are capitalised goodwill and trademarks with an inde nite useful life. this is because the amounts involved are substantial and the value of the asset is based on recognition principles from purchase price allocations. valuations relating to these long term assets are described extensively in note 17. the value of joint ventures essentially consists of the group s 50 ownership interest in sapa. the valuation is based on the contribution in kind at the time the subsidiary became a joint venture in 2013 see note 7. other estimates and assumptions are disclosed in various notes and any inf ormation that is not logically included in other notes is presented in note 39 other matters. the branded consumer goods area has provisions related to customer bonuses discounts and joint marketing. these are recognised as reductions in revenues. the revenue reductions are largely mathematical in the form of an invoice discount and joint marketing agreements. to a large degree this also applies to annual bonuses. other reductions in revenue must be estimated due to the fact that externally sourced data are not available until after the nancial statements have been presented. this entails an inherent risk of estimate variances. in the past few years there have been no material variances. future events and changes in operating parameters may make it necessary to change estimates and assumptions. new interpretations of standards may result in changes in the choice of principles and presentation. such changes will be recognised in the nancial statements when new estimates are prepared and whenever new requirements regarding presentation are introduced. these matters are discussed in both the section on principles and other notes. exercise of judgement the nancial statements mayected by the choice of accounting principles and the judgement exercised in applying them. this applies for instance to the assessment of whether a discontinued operation is to be presented on a separate line and the date on which this is to be done. material non recurring items and items substantially relating to other periods will be presented as other income and expenses on a separate line of the income statement. these are included in the group s operating pro t but not in ebit adj. broken down by segment. orkla has also chosen to present pro t or loss from associates and joint ventures after operating pro t. it is important to note that use oferent set of assumptions for the presentation of the nancial statements would have resulted in signi cant changes in the income statement presented. accounting principles notes group annual report 2014notes group changes in the group and developments relating to partly owned companies note 6 business combinations acquisitions affect the comparison with last year s figures and the changes in the various notes must be seen in the light of this. acquired companies are presented in the financial statements from the date on which control transfers to the group and for most of the acquisitions figures are in dicated for profit or loss before and after the date of acquisition. the date of control is normally the date on which the contract takes effect and all official approvals have been obtained. the date of control will normally be after the contract date. amounts in nok milliondate

has both defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans. in the defined contribution pension plans the company pays an agreed annual contribu tion to the employee s pension plan but any risk related to the return is borne by the employee. the future pension will be determined by the amount of the regular contributions and the return on the pension savings. in a defined benefit plan the company is responsible for paying an agreed pension to the employee based on his or her final pay. the cost for the accounting period shows the employees pension entitlement of the agreed future pension in the financial year. the majority of orkla s pension plans are defined contribution plans. de ned contribution plans de ned contribution plans comprise arrangements whereby the company makes annual contributions to the employees pension plans and where the future pension is determined by the amount of the contributions and the return on the pension plan assets. contribution plans also comprise pension plans that are common to several companies and where the pension premium is determined independently of the demographic pro le in the individual companies multi employer plans. employees in the orkla group are mainly covered by pension plans classi ed as contribution plans. orkla has adjusted the contribution rates for the companies in norway considering the new limits laid down in regulations for contribution rates for private company pension plans with ect from 1 september 2014. see note 5 to the nancial statements for orkla asa. de ned bene t plansthe group has de ned bene t pension plans that are classi ed as funded and unfunded. a large part of the group s de ned bene t plans are in sweden and norway. these countries account for around 57 and 36 respectively of the group s net carried pension liabilities. sweden the pension plans in sweden are net plans that do not link the group s liabilities to changes in swedish social security. the plans are largely determined by collective agreements. they are not funded but provisions are made in the companies statement of nancial position. to secure accrued pension rights companies must take out a credit insurance in the pri pensionsgaranti insurance company. pri pensionsgaranti records and calculates the companies pension liabilities. according to the collective agree ments all employees born in 1979 or later must be covered by a de ned contribution plan which means that the number of de ned bene t plans will gradually be reduced. the group also has some pension plans primarily related to senior executives nanced through endowment insurances. the gross amount of these plans is reported in the nancial statements. account has been taken of payroll tax on the pension liabilities in sweden. norway net pension liabilities in norway mainly consist of unfunded pension plans for former key personnel early retirement schemes for the group executive board and book liabilities related to contribution based plans for employees who earn more than twelve times the norwegian national insurance scheme s basic amount 12g. the pension plan for employees in norway who earn more than 12g is a contribution based plan but is treated as a de ned bene t plan in accordance with ifrs. the sum of the accrued contributions and the return on the plan assets are thus presented as a de ned bene t plan with pension liabilities in the company s statement of nancial position. a small part of the pension liability also consists of provisions made to cover the under funding in the old contractual early retirement afp scheme as recommended under the norwegian accounting standards. the new afp scheme is a multi employer de ned bene t plan but is recognised as a de ned contribution plan. this is in line with the ministry of finance s conclusion regarding the new afp which was published in connection with the presentation of the government budget on 14 october 2013. companies that participate in the afp scheme are jointly responsible for two thirds of the payable pension. all of the companies in annual report 2014income statement items notes group the orkla group in norway participate in the afp scheme. the premium for the new afp scheme will increase from 2. 2 in 2014 to 2. 4 in 2015 of total payments of wages between 1 and 7. 1 times the average basic amount. this change in premium is in line with the announced change whereby the premium for the new afp scheme for the years 2011 2015 is gradually to be increased as the premiums and employer s contributions for the old afp scheme are phased out. assumptions relating to de ned bene t plans as from the 2012 nancial year the discount rate in norway is xed on the basis of norwegian covered bonds omf. the norwegian accounting standards board considers the omf marky deep market to be used for computing the discount rate. orkla has chosen a discount rate based on the average life of the pensions in each company and in each pension plan. in cases where the life exceeds 15 years the omf yield curve has been extrapolated on the basis of the swap rate. the discount rate has been reduced in every country due to the generally lower interest rate level. in norway the discount rate varies between 1. 4 and 2. 3 depending on the life of the pension. the discount rate in sweden is based on swedish covered bonds and was reduced to 3. 0 for 2014 from 4. 0 in 2013. parameters such as wage growth increase in the basic amount g and in ation are set in accordance with recommendations in the various countries and the level of these parameters was also reduced somewhat due to the generally lower interest rate level. the mortality estimate is based on updated mortality tables for the various countries k2013 in norway and updated mortality tables as at 30 june 2011 in sweden. the actuarial gains and losses are recognised in comprehensive income oci and are essentially related to changes in economic assumptions. a reasonable expected change in key assumptions will have no material impact on the gures for the group. pension plan assets virtually all the group s pension plans with pension plan assets are in the netherlands switzerland and the uk. pension plan assets are mainly invested in bonds and shares. the estimated return will vary depending on the composition of the various classes of assets. a

in norway sweden and denmark is substantial. the ordinary tax rate for companies domiciled in norway was reduced from 28 toective from 2014. the norwegian company tax rate has been stable at 28 throughout the period 1992 2013. limitations were imposed on the deduction for intra group interest expenses in norway as from 2014. in the course of 2014 orkla adapted its capital structure and will obtain a full deduction for internal interest expenses in 2014. company tax rates in finland and denmark were also reduced from 24. 5 and 25 to 20 and 24. 5 respectively in 2014. ects of the reduced tax rates on the temporaryerences at the start of the year were recognised already in 2013. at that time net tax liabilities in norway finland and denmark were reduced by a total of nok 20 million primarily norwegian tax. orkla s operations in countries with tax rates other than 27 make a net contribution towards reducing tax expense. in 201ect of this contribution was a reduction of nok 117 million in tax expense of which the swedish subsidiaries account for just under nok 50 million. pro t from associates and joint ventures are recognised on an after tax basis and thus do not impact the group s tax expense but thereby have a positivect on the ective tax rate. the group has gains losses and dividends covered by the tax exemption method which are not subject to normal taxation or deduction but for which 3 of net pro t or loss is recognised in the income statement. this applies in particular to shares and nancial assets. shares and nancial assets contribute to rective tax rate.

proceedings instituted by statkraft it was claimed that aktieselskapet saudefaldene was the owner for tax purposes of the s nn h y power plant which saudefaldene built in the saudavassdraget riv er system and which it utilises along with other plants and installations in accordance with the lease agreement with statkraft. orkla owns 85 of saudefaldene. saudefaldene submitted a writ of summons against the norwegian government claiming that the decision handed down in december 2011 must be ruled invalid. this legal action has been suspended pending a nal decision on the amendment of saudefaldene s tax assessment. in 2014 a decision was made on saudafaldene s appeal with the conclusion that the company is deemed to be the owner of s nn h y for tax purposes. a writ of summons has also been submitted against this appeal decision and the case is expected to come before the district court in the summer of 2015. no decision has yet been made on the amendment of saudefaldene s tax assessment with regard to property tax in this case. as part of the same case a writ of summons has also been submitted against sauda municipality with the argument that saudefaldene cannot be required to pay property tax for s nn h y. odda munic ipality has similarly led a writ of summons against saudefaldene arguing that the company is liable for property tax for s nn h y. in addition similar appeal proceedings are currently in progress in odda municipality. this because s nn h y consists of installations in three municipalities. so far a total of around nok 55 million in property tax has been paid for s nn h y for the period 2010 2014. note 16 earnings per share earnings per share are one of several indicators that can be used in financial analyses to assess a company s performance. this key figure shows how much the profit or loss for the period amounts to per share and is calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the period after non controlling interests by the average number of shares outstanding. earnings per share are calculated on the basis of pro t for the year after non controlling interests. as a result of the orkla group s option programme see note 10 outstanding shares may be diluted when options are exercised. in order to take into account this future increase in the number of shares outstanding diluted earnings per share are calculated in addition to basic earnings per share. in this calculation the average number of shares outstanding is adjusted to take into account the estimated diluting ect of the option programme. amounts in

notes group routine monitoring of non current assets the orkla group has material non current assets in the form of both tangible property plant and equipment and intangible assets. an explanation of the details of and changes in these assets is presented in note 18 and note 19. the group also has other non current assets that mainly consist of investments in companies recognised using the equity method. these are disclosed in note 7 and are not covered in the description below. estimate uncertainty in some cases considerable attaches to property plant and equip ment and intangible assets. both valuation and estimated useful life are based on future information that is always subject to a certain degree of uncertainty. tangible assets property plant and equipment are initially capitalised at acquisition cost and if they have a limited useful life will be systematically depreciated over that period. account is taken of residual value. useful life and residual value are based on estimates of future development. the uncertainty is perhaps greatest where intangible assets are concerned. these assets have no direct cost price and their value is primarily derived from the group s own valuations and has generally been capitalised in connection with the group s acquisition of a new business. goodwill is to be regarded as a residual in the same acquisition. consequently the total of all excess value including goodwill related to the acquisitions is basically to be regarded as the market value fair value of the total net assets and the breakdown by various types of assets liabilities is based on this total. the orkla group routinely monitors assets and if there are indications that the value of an asset is no longer recoverable an impairment test will immediately be carried out to determine whether the asset can still justify its carrying value. if new estimates conclude that the value is no longer re coverable the asset is written down to the re coverable amount i. e. the greater of the net sales value and the value in use discounted cash ow. due to continued low power prices and the current tax case see note 15 the valuation of the sauda power plants has also been updated. the valuation is based on future estimates of power prices and contract based production in the lease period as well as on the value at the time the plants are returned to statkraft. the wacc applied re ects lower risk than for other group companies. the assessment carried out justi es the group s investment in saudefaldene. apart from the loss on the divestment of the russian business no impairments in value were found in the group in 2014. assets with an inde nite useful life goodwill and intangible assets with an inde nite useful life are not amortised on a regular basis. these assets are therefore tested at least annually for impairment. at orkla impairment testing is carried out in the third quarter. if there are special indications of a reduction in value impairment testing is carried out more frequently see above. cash ows relating to the assets are identi ed and discounted. future cash ow is based on speci ed assumptions see separate table in this note and the plans adopted by the unit. if the discounted value of future cash ows is lower than the capitalised value of the unit s capital employed the assets are written down to the re coverable amount. if the discounted value is higher than the capital employed this means that the value of the intangible asset or goodwill is re coverable. in c ases where the discounted value exceeds the capital employed by less than 20 a further sensitivity analysis is carried out to check the calculation. where relevant assumptions and estimates are reviewed and the robustness of the investment is measured in relation thereto. alternatively the sales value of the asset will be calculated to determine whether it justi es maintaining the carrying value. trademarks with an inde nite useful life are tested for impairment by discounting estimates of the future sales value of the trademark and measuring them against the trademark s carrying value. this process is based on a model whereby the trademark s discounted value is calculated on the basis of a percentage rate that indicates the strength of the trademark. this strength was assumed at the time of acquisition and is basically maintained in the impairment testing. the table below shows the most important goodwill and trademarks. capitalised items in foreign currencies mainly increased from 2013 to 2014 due to the weakening of the norwegian krone against the respective currencies see note 18. goodwilltrademarks amounts in nok million2014201320142013 orkla foods norge 3 3443 3691 2601 260orkla foods sverige 1

the lowest level at which independent cash ows can be measured. the highest level of a cgu will in any event be a reported segment. none of the reported segments as at 31 december 2014 constituted a separate cgu. some of the operations in orkla foods are in companies that have been part of the group for a very long time. no capitalised intangible assets are associated with these companies as was the case for the former stabburet in orkla foods norge. since the acquisition of rieber s n the situation has changed. rieber s n norge has been fully integrated into orkla foods norge and excess value associated with the acquisition must be justi ed by the unit as an aggregate. the same situation applies to the rieber s n businesses that were taken over in sweden fr dinge integrated into orkla foods sverige and denmark rieber s n danmark integrated into orkla foods danmark. here too the excess value must be justi ed by the aggregate units. orkla foods sverige formerly procordia and abba seafood was acquired in 1995 and goodwill associated with these operations was amortised by 1 20 per year in the period from the acquisition to 1 january 2004 when the group switched to reporting under ifrs. this means that the original goodwill from these acquisitions has been approximately halved in relation to the acquisition cost. the business structure of orkla confectionery snacks has been organised as one company per country. this means that the impairment of goodwill will be tested at this level. the new test level is higher than under the former structure. in orkla home personal lilleborg has been in the group for a long time. since the acquisition of jordan the situation has changed and jordan excl. house care has been fully integrated into lilleborg. the excess value associated with the acquisition must be justi ed by the new unit as an aggregate. the same situation applied to acquisitions made in orkla health in 2005 and 2006 collett pharma and dansk droge. it was impossible to identifyerent cash ows because the new units were ext ensively integrated into the existing operations. the units in orkla health are therefore tested for impairment on an aggregate basis and integration with the units that were already part of orkla prior to the acquisition generate an aggregate return well above the required rate. orkla health is part of orkla home personal. orkla food ingredients consists of manyerent units which are mainly separate cgus and are tested individually. around 20 cgus are tested. note 17 impairment assessments the value of long term capitalised assets will largely be based on discretionary assessment and estimates. it is important that the financial statement users are familiar with the assumptions that apply to the valuation of these assets and the way the group assesses future earnings. there will be particular focus on assets that are not initially depreciated or amortised. in the orkla group s financial statements this will largely concern goodwill and trademark s with an indefinite useful life. annual report 2014notes group statement of financial position items orkla eiendom has in the past acquired and sold real estate companies. the remaining portfolio mainly consists of capto eiendom formerly fg eiendom. most of the excess value arising from this acquisition has been allocated to property plant and equipment and associates. trademarks in the case of trademarks a new organisational structure will normally not change the possibility of measuring the strength of the various trademarks. the trademarks continue to exist in the new organisation and in most cases it will be possible to identify them in future. the value of a trademark will be dynamic and new products launched under the trademark in question will help to maintain the value of the trademark. budget assumptionsthe branded consumer goods business is basically relatively stable in terms of market uctuations. future cash ows are estimated on the basis of a number of assumptions. this applies both to factors such as assumptions concerning economic trends and factors such as the estimated useful life of important trademarks. cash ow estimates are sensitive to changes in raw material prices and thereby other purchase prices and the associated ability to maintain margin assumptions and market shares. future cash ows are estimated on the basis of the budget for next year and the following two forecast years. as from year four a terminal value is calculated. the largest cash generating units cgus are shown in a separate table by segment. the main companies in each segment are presented and the main factors on which the impairment tests are based are summed up. the cguserent markets and the table is intended to provide an overview of the primary drivers. see also the separate brand table in noor an overall picture of trademarks that have been capitalised capitalised through goodwill and not capitalised. discount rate the discount rate applied is based on the group s cost of capital which is estimated to be 8. 7 before tax based on a weighted average of required rates of return for the group s equity and debt wacc. the required rate of return on the group s equity is estimated by using the capital asset pricing model capm. the required rate of return on debt is estimated on the basis of a long term risk free interest rate to which is added a credit margin derived from orkla s marginal long term borrowing rate. the discount rate is adjusted for country risk the level of in ation and operational risk depending on the particular value being calculated. sensitivitythe largest trademarks and goodwill items are related to businesses that are developing well. since the reorganisation in 2013 especially in orkla confectionery snacks trade marks and goodwill will be tested at a higher level in several cases. trademarks will be tested for impairment regardless of the reorganisation. the panda brand was recognised at eur 44 million in orkla confectionery snacks. the brand has delivered a slightly negative performance in the past year and several measures have been taken to strengthen the value of the brand. the impairment test that was carried out justi es the brand s value based on current assumptions about the future. no trademarks or goodwill items were written down in 2014. annual report 2014statement of financial position items notes group key assumptions for estimating future performance orkla foodsorkla confectionery snacks oc s amounts in nok

physical assets that have largely been capitalised in connection with the acquisition of a company. intangible assets classified as non amortisable have an indefinite useful life and it is impossible on the balance sheet date to foresee when the asset will ce ase to have value. goodwill is not regularly amortised either. other intangible assets are amortised over their useful life. amortisation is reported on a separate line in the income statement. expenses relating to product development are expensed as and when they are incurred. it consists of customised software and will differ from other i ntangible assets in terms of the need for reinvestment. amortisation of it is therefore included in depreciation property plant and equipment in the income statement. intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill are tested for impairment at least once a year. if there is any indication of a reduction in value in the cou rse of the year for all types of immaterial assets and goodwill the recoverable amount is calculated and the asset will if relevant be written down to its value in use. intang ible assets and goodwill will be subject to considerable estimation uncertainty. amortisable intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis at the following rates trademarks 10 20 and it 16 33. i ntangible assets are broken down by segments in note 8 and

note 19 property plant and equipment property plant and equipment are various types of assets that are necessary for the group s operating activities. unless there are significant changes in operating parameters these assets will largely necessitate corresponding reinvestment over time. they comprise such items as land buil dings plants machinery fixtures and fittings it equipment and vehicles. assets that have an indefinite useful life such as property are not depreciated while other asset s are depreciated over their remaining useful life taking into account their residual value. if there are indications of a decline in the value of a specific asset the rec overable value is calculated and if it is lower than the asset s sales value or value in use the asset is written down. annual ordinary depreciation is an indication of the extent of the need for corresponding reinvestment. property plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis at the following rates buildings 2 4 machinery xtur es and ttings 5 15 vehicles 15 25 and it equipment 16 33. the period of depreciation is reviewed each year and if there are changes in useful life depreciation is adjusted. the residual value is also calculated and if it is higher than the carrying value depreciation is stopped. this applies in particular to buildings. the table below covers both directly acquired assets and

may be made between provisions and other liabilities such as accounts payable because there is uncertainty regarding the settlement date or the amount of the future expenses. an enterprise has a liability when it is obliged to transfer financial resources to another party at a future date. this obligation may be self imposed if the enterprise through its decisions and actions has created expectations of its assuming a financial liability in the future e. g. in the form of the restructuring of parts of its operations. in such case agreed severance pay for employees would be a natural part of the restructuring provision. the liability will be reduced over time as the disbursements are made. a contingent liability is a possible obligation that will be confirmed by the future occurrence or non occurrence of one or more uncertain events. a contingent liability will only be recognised if it is likely 50 to arise and if the amount of the obligation can be measured reliably.

on the basis of the international private equity and venture capital valuation guidelines. several valuation methodologies are used to measure the fair value of unlisted investments. where there has been a recent arm s length transaction in the security in question the value is based on the transaction price. if there has been no recent arm s length transaction the value of the company is deduced from a relative valuation of comparable listed companies adjusted for erences in size and selection between comparable companies. valuation methodologies other than those described above are also used in cases where they better re ect the fair value of an unlisted investment. the fair value of unlisted fund shares solsten is measured as the share of the fund s assets as reported by the fund management. listed securitiesthe fair value of listed securities is based on the latest bid price. at the time of acquisition the shares are recognised at their value on the transaction date including transaction costs. prolonged or signi cant decline in value a prolonged decline in the value of a security classi ed as available for sale is de ned as having occurred if the market value of a share is lower than the acquisition cost for more than two successive quarters six months or if the market value is more than 25 lower than the cost price. once an investment has been written down further value impairment will result in an immediate further write down. unrealised gains erence between the fair value and acquisition cost of the security is included in the unrealised gain until the security is either sold or written down. when the security is sold or written down the unrealised gain is recognised in the income statement and omprehensive income. when the security is written down a new acquisition price is established and subsequent increases in fair value are recognised in compre hensive income as changes in unrealised gains. market risk relating to the share portfolio the greatest risk factor is a general stock market decline or a major drop in the price of shares in an individual company in which the share portfolio is highly exposed. risk management is handled through clearly de ned authorisations and mandates and other quality assurance procedures. change in fair value shares and nancial assetsamounts in nok million20142013 opening balance fair value

unexpected events. it is therefore important to provide information that enables users of the financial statements to understand the company s goals policy and management of the company s capital base. orkla s capital management is designed to ensure that the gr exibility short term and long term. one main objective is to maintain a nancial structure that through solidity and cash ow secures the group s strong long term creditworthiness as well as a good return for the shareholders. orkla s dividend policy is described in corporate governance section 3. in allocating capital for acquisitions and other in vestments the weighted average cost of capital wacc adjusted for project speci c risk is applied. available liquidity should at all times at least cover l oan instalments that fall due over the next 12 months known capital needs and a reserve in addition to the afore mentioned. orkla s liquidity reserve beyond cash and cash equivalents primarily consists of unutilised long term credit lines under bilateral bank facilities. the group uses several sources of long term loan capital wher eof banks and bond markets are the most impor tant. external borrowing is centralised at parent level and capital needs in subsidiaries are mainly covered by internal loans or equity. capital structure in subsidiaries is adapted to commercial as well as legal and tax considerations. the short term liquidity of group companies is managed at group level through cash pools. for funding of partly owned subsidiaries orkla normally either provides loans according to its share of capital jointly with other shareholders or external funding is established. orkla s management of funding is further described in note 29 credit rating but actively monitors quantitative and qualitative measures ect the creditworthiness of the group. annual report 2014financial instruments notes group note 29 funding and interest interest bearing liabilities together with unutilised credit facilities available liquid assets and equity constitute the ca pital available to the group. the composition and the level of gross interest bearing liabilities plus unutilised credit facilities are managed as part of the group s funding ac tivity. changes in net interest bearing liabilities result from the cash flow of the group. the group s capital consists of net interest

through 2014 largelyected by the listing and sales of shares in gr nges for nok 2. 3 billion. there were no changes in orkla s approach and goals regarding nancial management in 2014. as an industrial

nominal interest rate is not an expression of the group s actual interest cost since various interest rate swaps have been agreed on. note 30 discloses further details of interest rate levels interest rate risk and a break down of the liabilities portfolio by currency. funding the primary goal of orkla s nancial policy is to ensure that the gr nancial exibility in the short and long term to achieve its strategic and operational objectives. orkla s policy is to have unutilised long term committed credit facilities which together with liquid deposits aro cover l oans that fall due and known capital needs over the next 12 months as well as a strategic reserve. this means that orkla s credit facilities are normally re nanced one year before maturity and that short term interest bearing debt is at all times covered by unutilised long term credit facilities. commercial paper and money markets are used as a source of liquidity when conditions in these markets are competitive as an alternative to drawing on unutilised committed long term credit facilities. as of 31 december 2014 there were no drawings on these credit facilities. orkla s main sources of nancing are bilateral loans from orkla s relationship banks and loans in the norwegian bond market. funds have also been raised in the us private placement market and historically in the german schuldschein market. the group treasury also continuously assesses other funding sources. the term to maturity for new loans and credit facilities is normally 5 10 years. in 2014 orkla repaid loans and cancell ed credit facilities totalling nok 4. 4 billion. new bilateral loan agreements totalling nok 1. 5 billion were entered into and an existing bond was increased by nok 0. 1 billion. orkla has no loan agreements with nancial covenants for the group or for orkla asa. the loan agreements include some limitations on disposals of businesses creation of security interest on assets borrowing at subsidiary level and cross default clauses. bonds issued in the norwegian bond market are listed on the oslo stock exchange. annual report 2014the maturity pro les of the group s interest bearing liabilities and unutilised committed credit facilities are shown to the right in the table below. the group also has cash pools and bank accounts with short term credit lines. unutilised credit lines on these accounts are not included in the table. as of 31 december 2014 the average time to maturity on the group s combined non current interest bearing liabilities and unutilised credit facilities wears

financial risks within each of the business areas and the management of these risks. market risk connected to financial instruments currency risk interest rate risk and price risk for input factors and sold products liquidity risk and credit risk are described specifically. in addition to loans and receivables the financial instruments consist of derivatives used for hedging market risk. derivatives and hedging relationships are described in more detail in note 31. i organisation of financial risk management orkla operates internationally and is exposed to nancial risks like currency risk interest rate risk commodity price risk liquidity risk and credit risk. orkla uses derivatives and other nancial instruments to reduce these risks in accordance with the group s nancial policy. the responsibility for managing nancial risk in orkla is divided between business areas which manage risk related to business processes and group level which manages risk related to centralised activities like funding interest rate management and currency risk management. centralised risk management orkla has a central group treasury. its most important tasks are to ensure the group s nancial exibility in the short and long term and to monitor and manage nancial risk in cooperation with individual operational entities. the guidelines for the group treasury are set out in the group s nance policy. the group executive board monitors nancial risk by means of regular reporting and meetings of the orkla treasury committee. the group treasury acts as the internal bank for the group and is responsible for and executes all major external funding and hedging transactions relating to currency and interest rate hedging. each year the board of directors grants authorisation for establishing loans and entering into master agreements for nancial instruments. debt and treasury positions are managed in a non speculative manner such that all transactions in nancial instruments are matched to an underlying business requirement. financial risks within each business area this section describes the most important risk factors within each business area of the group and the management of these. in this context nancial risk is de ned as risk related to nancial instruments. these may either be hedging instruments for underlying risk or viewed as a source of risk themselves. market risk not hedged with nancial instruments is also discussed in this section. branded consumer goods entities within this area are primarily located in the nordic countries and central eastern europe. production and sales mainly take place in local markets. a signi cant part of the input factors are imported as well as some nished goods. the two primary sources of nancial risk within this business area are price risk on agricultural products and ingredients in food production and currency risk on imported goods. price risk on raw materials is normally dealt with in commercial contracts. the most signi cant currency risk results from import in eur by norwegian and swedish entities. currency risk related to expected non contractual cash ows is normally not hedged but to a large extent re ected in the prices of sold products. contracts and committed transactions are hedged with currency forward contracts against its own functional currency. hydro power hydro power is a signi cant producer of hydroelectric power see note 32. a substantial part of the production is sold under long t erm contracts whereas the remainder is sold in the spot market. where contractual commitments exceed available power from own production this is covered through purchases in the power market. shares and nancial assets shares and nancial assets include listed and unlisted shares and investments described in note 23. the shares and investments are exposed to price movements. ii categories of financial risk for the group currency risk as nok is the presentation currency for the group orkla is exposed to currency translation risk on net investments in foreign operations. orkla maintains as far as possible a distribution of its net interest bearing liabilities across currencies which corresponds to the relative enterprise value distribution across the foreign subsidiaries home currencies. this ensures the same hedging level in all currencies where net interest bearing liabilities hedge the currency risk in enterprise value. in the balance sheet translation risk on net investments in foreign subsidiaries is reduced by the net interest bearing liabilities in the same currency. these consist of hedges of internal loans from orkla asa to subsidiaries in their home currency plus hedges of net investments according to ias 39. orkla primarily uses loans and forward currency contracts to hedge internal loans and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. at the operational level transaction risk is hedged against each entity s functional currency as described in i organisation of nancial risk management. orkla applies hedge accounting for most hedges of future transactions mainly cash ow hedges. erent types of hedges are described in note 31. the group s aggregated outstanding currency hedges of future transactions as of 31 december 2014 are shown in table 1. table 1 foreign exchange contracts 1 linked to hedging of future

nok 20 million. notes group financial instruments annual report 2014financial instruments notes group interest rate risk orkla s interest rate risk is mainly related to the group s debt portfolio. this risk is managed at group level. the group s policy is that interest costs should mainly follow the general trend in money market rates. further steps are takects of short term uctuations in money market rates. material decisions regarding interest hedging are made by the orkla treasury committee. the interest risk pro le of the debt portfolio is determined by selection of interest periods on the group s loans and the use of currency and interest rate derivatives. as of 31 december 2014 43 46 in 2013 of the group s gross interest bearing liabilities was at xed interest rates for periods exceeding one year. the interest rate exposure on interest bearing liabilities broken down by currency and nancial instrument is shown in table 2a and 2b. table 2a interest bearing liabilities by

when necessary dr awings on unutilised credit facilities. unutilised committed credit facilities the maturity pro le of which is shown in note 29 totalled nok 7. 4 billion at 31 december 2014. liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that orkla is not able to meet its payment obligations. the management of liquidity risk has high priority as a means of meeting the objective of nancial exibility. orkla s policy for funding activities described in note 29 implies that short term inter est bearing liabilities and known capital expenditures are funded by long term loans or credit facilities at least one year prior to maturity. the cash ow from operations which among other ected by changes in working capital is managed operationally by the business areas and is largely stable with the largest net in ow during the fourth quarter. group treasury monitors liquidity ows short and long term through reporting. interest bearing liabilities are managed together with interest bearing assets at group level. due to the above mentioned measures the group has limited liquidity risk. in order to further reduce re nancing risk orkla seeks to ensure that the maturities of loans and credit facilities are evenly distributed. the table shows the maturity pro le for the group s contractual nancial liabilities including liabilities which are not recognised in the nancial position. the amounts represent undiscounted future cash ows and may therefore deviate from recognised gures. derivatives are presented as split between those with gross settlement currency and those with net settlement interest and for 2013 aluminium. the table also includes derivatives recognised as assets on the balance sheet date as derivatives may include both positive and negative cash ows and the fair value uctuates over time. forward interest rate curves are applied to estimate future interest payments. similarly forward prices are used to determine the future settlement amounts for currency and aluminium derivatives. credit risk the management of credit risk related to accounts receivable and other operating receivables is handled as part of the business risk and is continuously monitored by the operating entities. the nordic markets for grocery trade are characterised by relatively few but large participants which results in a certain concentration of the credit risk exposure towards individual counterparts. when selling in countries with high political risk trade nance products are used to a certain extent to reduce the credit risk. the current credit risk level is considered acceptable. provisions have been made for losses on accounts receivable and the recognised amount represents the fair value as of the balance sheet date. the provisions and the age distribution of accounts receivable are shown in note 24. orkla s credit risk related to nancial instruments is managed by group treasury. risk arises from nancial hedging transactions money market deposits and bank accounts. firstly orkla seeks to minimise the liquid assets deposited outside the group. secondly relationship banks that provide long term funding are the targeted counterparties for bank accounts and nancial hedge transactions according to policy. further limits and requirements related to the banks credit ratings apply for deposits of liquidity. the risk is continuously monitored by group treasury and is considered to be low. orkla asa has international swap dealers association isda agreements with its counterparts for derivative interest rate and currency transactions which provide for netting of settlement risk. annual report 2014financial instruments notes group maximum credit risk the maximum credit exposure for the group related to nancial

respect of a number of raw materials in particular agricultural products. however the prices of sold products arected by raw material prices and it is generally orkla s policy to reduce the price risk through com mercial contracts. commodity price risk is described for the individual business areas in section i organisation of nancial risk management. sensitivity analysis the nancial instruments of

the international community is actively pursuing activities aimed at achieving carbon neutrality by focusing on effective methods for reducing greenhouse gases. while some are calling for stronger regulations such as implementing a carbon border tax and a plastic tax there has been a rapid increase in investments being made into the eco friendly business sector. the energy sector is at the center of these changes as we can see the industry shifting from the usage of fossil fuels for power generation to more sustainable energy sources in order to realize the vision of a low carbon economy. in line with the global trends centered around eco friendly business practices the south korean government joined the commitment to the paris climate agreement of reducing greenhouse gases to 37 below bau business as usual levels. to this end the 2050 carbon neutrality strategy was released in december 2020 outlining the detailed plans for implementing the related initiatives. with an increasing number of countries declaring their commitment to carbon neutrality and with esg management being promoted at a wider scale it is forecast that there will be some additional upward adjustments of the targets in 2021. thus we expect that the governmental policies concerning the shift to sustainable clean energy will be further strengthened. with the world being hit by the covid 19 pandemic this had the effect of further highlighting the seriousness of the climate change issue caused some fundamental changes to the criteria used in assessing companies sustainability and emphasized the importance of managing esg risks along with financial results like profitability and revenue. despite the worldwide drop in energy demand caused by the covid 19 situation the demand for renewable energy continued to show a steady growth signifying that the paradigm shift in the energy sector had already started. doosan heavy industries construction s strategy in response to the changes in the government s energy policies and global industry trends dhic has been preparing for the restructuring of our business portfolio to be more oriented toward the businesses identified as

strategies to counter climate change in order to devise effective strategies to counter climate change we have identified the related risks and opportunities and assessed the overall risk factors and business impact to determine ways to reduce the related risks. the transition risk related viewpoint is particularly noteworthy as the industrial shift of the energy sector to renewable energy will pose both risks and opportunities to our company. physical risk sudden risks costs for recovery when large disasters occur e. g. earthquakes heavy rain thunder storm constant risks increase in manufacturing facility operating costs owing to rising temperatures opportunities products services market growing demand of businesses for high efficiency eco friendly energy due to promotion of the renewable energy sector possible to adopt various types of new technology and renewable energy e. g. blue green hydrogen. growing market for dt based power plant equipment services such as energy saving solutions will acquire more intangible assets such as greater brand value by earning a reputation as an eco friendly company analysis of climate change related risks opportunities esg checklist our company has developed a climate change response related esg checklist which is applied throughout the various stages of technology development pursued to discover new growth engines starting from the planning to the researching and final completion all of which will help us to take preemptive action. our business characteristics and esg management guidelines were taken into account when

market and business opportunities 4041core issues business strategies concerning transition risk we are devising business strategies based on the market opportunity assessments that we performed for the various energy sources. the renewable energy business is expected to grow owing to the improved financial feasibility and increase in governments support policies and detailed governmental policies and roadmaps are being released on hydrogen which is emerging as a new viable source of energy. owing to the downsizing of coal fired power plants gas fired power plants is expected to become a popular alternative baseload power plant and will also be used to complement the intermittent renewable energy. we have identified some new business opportunities in the korean market which involve converting aged coal fired power plants into gas fired combined cycle power plants. we are seeing numerous new business opportunities being developed in the domestic market in response to climate change such as large sized offshore wind farms solar pv energy development projects korean type standard gas fired combined cycle power plant projects and hydrogen production supply projects. in line with the market trends we have defined the strengthening of our business portfolio focusing on the businesses defined as our new growth engines as our key strategic plan. as such we will be investing in and pursuing growth in namely four areas renewable energy gas hydrogen and smrs small modular reactors. in the short term we will be focusing on completing the development of our clean energy business model in korea and by leveraging our successful track record in korea we aim to expand into the overseas market to ultimately become the global leader of the clean energy sector. strategy for addressing physical risks we have defined early risk management integrated energy environment management system implementation and expansion of green technology for the generation of business results

council in order to establish an effective system for addressing climate change one that is aligned with the various aspects of our business such as procurement shared growth strategies technology development and improvement of energy efficiency. the target is to have the council launched in 2021. strategies for greenhouse gas reduction doosan devised greenhouse gas reduction targets and implementation strategies as a way to effectively address the risks related to climate change. in 2020 we applied the science based targets initiative sbti s absolute contraction approach to conduct an analysis on the greenhouse gas emissions reduction trend identified in climate change scenarios showing temperatures well below 2 and 1. 5. along with this we considered the domestic renewable energy market situation and financial feasibility to set our greenhouse gas reduction targets. our company is implementing a two track plan for greenhouse gas reduction that involves improving energy efficiency while also seeking to acquire carbon credit. we are carrying out activities aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from our business sites and plant facilities and are performing scenario analyses on climate change risk factors to derive greenhouse gas emission estimates which are used to assess financial impact. in addition we are assessing the costs and benefits arising from adoption of the ets emissions trading scheme to be able to define the countermeasures by priority and this is all incorporated into our business decisions. we also became a registered member of the climate exchange association in 2020 and have been striving to improve our skills in managing carbon emission goals through effective energy management and carbon credit related training programs. risk management our company has risks classified into financial risks and non financial risks and we have a special risk management organization set up for each risk type. the groups handle the overall process from identification of the risks to addressing the risks and devising improvement plans. while each risk type is managed by the managing organization s own internal council the integrated risk monitoring results are also reviewed at a corporate wide level on a regular basis. the risks that have occurred are directly reported to the ceo and major risks are escalated to the board of directors so that the most optimal decision can be reached on how to address them. climate change is being managed from a corporate wide integrated risk management perspective. metrics targets in line with the south korean government s energy policies our company has set a target of reducing greenhouse gases to a level that is 15 lower than the 2017 emissions by 2030. to achieve

matters key audit matters are those matters that in our professional judgment were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 1. recognition of revenue such as using the input method as described in the note 2 to the consolidated financial statements the group recognizes its revenue when the control of products and services is transferred to the customers. therefore the group estimates percentage of completion of performance obligation satisfied over time by using the input method and recognizes revenue over time depending on the progress. for performance obligations satisfied at a point of time the group recognizes revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. as the amount of revenue recognized over time using the input method depends on the measured percentage of completion management s judgment is involved in determining the method of measuring progress estimating total contract cost and changes in construction. in addition there is an inherent risk in revenue such as overstatement of unit sales price and manipulation of revenue through fictitious customers as revenue is one of the major performance indicators of the group. therefore as there is a risk of overstatement of revenue due to an error in judgment or intent we have identified the recognition of revenue as a key audit matter. following audit procedures were performed regarding the revenue recognized using the input method. evaluation and testing of internal controls related to the determination and modification of

financial statements our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error

procedures responsive to those risks and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error as fraud may involve collusion forgery intentional omissions misrepresentations or the override of internal control. obtain an understanding of

data come from the living forests report published by the world wildlife fund wwf a leading international nonprofit focused on environmental conservation. the study concluded that the pressure on native forests is still one of the major challenges our society faces. against this backdrop eucalyptus cultivation that respects the environment and people is becoming increasingly important as a driver of sustainable development. production of pulp and paper from a renewable raw material which is planted and harvested using sustainable management practices represents efficient use of natural resources and commitment to society. this is how suzano pulp and paper which was founded in 1924 and is owned by the suzano group builds a healthier relationship with natural ecosystems. by interspersing tracts of eucalyptus plantations with areas of natural vegetation our cultivation practices provide an environment which is conducive to conserving biodiversity natural resources and their respective cycles. our three forestry units in the states of bahia maranh o and s o paulo total 1. 2 million hectares 536 500 of which are set aside for preservation. this places us among the world s main defenders of protected areas in the pulp and paper industry. with the pulp we produce and the paper we manufacture we are present in the daily lives of billions of people in brazil and in the more than 70 countries where our products are exported. we cultivate life on the notebook sheets where children learn to read and write in the diapers that keep babies dry in the tissues that wipe

our objective is to identify assess prioritize address monitor and report the main risks associated with our business model. in this way we seek to guarantee the continuity and sustainability of our operations in line with our corporate strategy. our integrated risk management is based on the market s best practices coso erm and iso 31000 and global risk studies as well as our professional expertise in corporate risk analysis. we also take into account assessments by senior management to build a risk portfolio that includes evaluation of financial impacts compliance image and health safety and environment parameters as well as the likelihood of occurrence based on the inherent risk and maturity of the process. the risk management model and method apply to all pulp paper and

price fluctuations and specific characteristics of the markets in which we operate. in risk management we adopt strategies and tools to monitor exposure to market risks protect cash flow and mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates and commodity fluctuations. moreover appropriate management of our industrial units provides competitive advantages in production costs and greater resilience when prices drop. operations our risk management is meant to ensure the continuity of our activities and mitigate impacts caused by partial or temporary downtime in operations. these stoppages can be caused by different environmental factors which are continuously managed in order to avoid accidents or other events that present a risk to the physical integrity of employees and to equipment. our operations also depend on the distribution of inputs which are transported via a complex logistics network that includes roads railroads ports and warehouses. interruption of this flow of raw materials for reasons beyond our control may have an impact on our ability to keep operations running. climatic factors driven by the nature of our business model we proactively look at ways to develop sustainable alternatives for the continuity of our operations. these alternatives include the new wastewater treatment plant at the mucuri unit specific studies to understand the particularities of climate microregions and reduction of the average forest radius the distance between the mills and eucalyptus producing areas. our risk management process also monitors continuous efforts to reduce water consumption even though the company has already achieved high levels of efficiency in this respect as well as contingency plans for droughts in the regions where we are active caused by circumstances beyond our control. gri 102 15 103 1 103 2 103 3 26 economic performance increased demand for pulp driven by asian countries and lower supply levels on a global scale led to a rise in the price of this product in 2017. data from the pulp and paper products council pppc show that global pulp shipments grew by 3. 3 compared to 2016 to reach 50. 6 million tons last year. suzano s pulp sales grew by 2. 4 on the same comparative basis totaling 3. 6 million tons. the drop in the cost of wood resulting from a lower grade mix from third party suppliers and a reduction in the average forest radius distance from forest to plant led to a 3. 8 lower pulp cash cost. the brazilian paper market continued to face pressure from the macroeconomic scenario. according to data published by the brazilian tree industry ib domestic paper sales in 2017 fell by 1. 2 compared to the previous year while imports grew by 20. 8. suzano s paper sales remained practically stable compared to 2016 despite increased production of fluff pulp from the flex machine which can be adapted to manufacture eucafluff or printing and writing paper. revenues in the paper segment decreased 3 in comparison with the previous year. in 2017 suzano s consolidated net revenue grew by 6. 5 year over year totaling r 10. 5 billion. this increase is mainly the result of higher prices for hardwood

reflected in the long lasting relationships we build and the way we manage the impacts of our activities allowing us to create and share value in the long term and to take on commitments that extend far beyond our operations. our cultivation areas comprise three units unf bahia in bahia minas gerais and esp rito santo unf maranh o in maranh o par piau and tocantins and unf s o paulo in s o paulo. none of these units contain areas of native vegetation which were converted into eucalyptus plantantions since they are always established in areas previously used by man for other purposes. throughout the development of our eucalyptus plantations we have adopted techniques such as minimum tillage which keeps leaves bark and other natural elements in the soil as a way to prevent soil exhaustion and reduce the use of agrochemicals allowing us to harvest and replant in the same areas. we also use the mosaic planting system where natural areas are interspersed with eucalyptus plantations to maintain and develop fauna and flora species through ecological corridors. as part of our socio environmental conduct we also invest in the recovery of degraded lands and in the preservation and management of remnants of native vegetation working directly to protect the amazon atlantic forest and cerrado biomes. this initiative is a direct contribution of our business model to combating climate change since it builds carbon stocks as growing vegetation captures carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. sustainable cultivationgri 103 1 103 2 103 3 304 2 click hereto learn about our forest management plans 30 a study conducted at the request of our customers who use eucafluff the world s first commercially available bleached kraft fluff pulp demonstrated that eucalyptus cultivation within our forestry unit in the state of s o paulo has a positive carbon footprint. through our forest management activities our plantations help sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. positive footprint in the eucafluff chain alongside conservation of natural resources we reduce the carbon footprint of our forestry activities by not permitting areas to be burned in the process of cutting and harvesting eucalyptus. another positive aspect is the use of eucalyptus biomass to generate electricity which helps supply not only our units but also the brazilian grid boosting the share of renewable sources in the country s energy matrix. our governance model and the management systems for our plantation areas incorporate best practices and standards in order to create value for our stakeholders and the environment. sustainability is the driving force behind the tools and action plans we develop to minimize the environmental and social impacts of our

world challenged by growing population diminishing resources and climate change global wood demand is projected to increase three fold to 13 billion m 3 per annum by 2050. at suzano we invest in innovation and technology aimed at increasing the productivity of our eucalyptus plantations in a sustainable manner. futuragene our subsidiary focused on biotechnology solutions develops technologies to improve plantation productivity by enhancing and protecting yield optimising resource use efficiency. this means producing more wood from less land with lower inputs therefore making land available for other uses such as for food production or conservation. one of the technologies developed by futuragene which has already been approved for commercial use in brazil is a yield enhanced genetically modified eucalyptus variety that produces more wood when compared to conventional clones using the same planted area. although this variety has not yet been commercially deployed and is currently not used in our products this gm eucalyptus is an example of brazil s leadership in technological innovation and represents the most significant productivity milestone for the renewable plantation forest industry since the adoption of clonal technology in the early 1990 s. its potential use in the future will form part of the solution to meet increasing global wood demand and the need for more efficient use of natural resources in 2017 suzano implemented a pest monitoring tool that reduces the amount of biological or chemical products used. a total of 500 sticky traps containing adhesive were placed between trees at strategically chosen sample points spanning all the ecological zones of suzano s forests and plantations. the traps are collected by the production units on a monthly basis and sent to the forest protection laboratory in s o paulo where researchers and technicians monitor the fluctuation of forest pests and their natural enemies. this system is part of suzano s integrated pest management and accurately determines which control measures are required based on pest populations and their natural enemies. this means that fewer agricultural defenses are needed reducing costs through more efficient and effective use of these products while using fewer biological or chemical agents in the environment. pest control innovation in the face of declining land and water resources and the effects of climate change. futuragene has also advanced in its yield protection platform which is focused on tackling threats to plant productivity such as new pests and diseases. gri 103 1 103 2 103 3 33 33 water as an essential resource for the development of the trees we plant water is used in our fields in a rational and increasingly efficient manner. water is only used in post planting irrigation to ensure the survival of the seedlings during their first days in the stands. after this stage rainwater is the only source for the eucalyptus plantations and natural vegetation and also supplies springs and replenishes the groundwater. we consequently are strongly committed to finding solutions that reduce the risk of water shortages and we work to protect the springs and bodies of water located within our units. the importance of water led us to develop a monthly water balance tool which monitors rainfall and evapotranspiration in our natural areas and production units. the results are compared against our own network of weather stations in conjunction with the national institute of meteorology inmet station which allows us to assess the effect of rainfall on tree growth flow in rivers and streams and forestry operations namely soil preparation fertilization and irrigation. contrasting this data with the leaf area index in our plantations obtained via remote sensing allows us to identify the areas where eucalyptus trees experience more severe water stress in order to tailor surveillance and firefighting activities and define cultivation strategies with better adapted clones and wider spacing to ensure adequate tree growth using natural resources in a rational and optimized manner. evapotranspiration is the loss of water in the soil via evaporation and the loss of water in plants through transpiration. is a system that monitors the water status of our cultivated areas and is based on the scientific paper climatic zoning of brazil which already has over one thousand scientific citations worldwide. the monthly water balance click here to learn more gri 103 1 103 2 103 3 amongst other technologies futuragene

utilizing the technology to develop varieties of eucalyptus which are resistant to pests and diseases and for modifying wood properties. as with other technologies developed or in licensed by futuragene the company is open to sharing this technology through business relationships or through its partnerships with small growers in brazil. 34 planting the seeds of care goes far beyond managing our environmental impacts. it also means being attentive to people especially the communities in the regions where our forestry and industrial operations are located. establishing mechanisms for continuous and transparent dialog and understanding how we can contribute to social and economic development in these communities are part of our strategy to create and share value generating long lasting and consistent results for our business. the model we have adopted to strengthen our relationship with neighboring communities and foster regional development involves community councils which are primarily made up of community members with participation by suzano. depending on the topic to be addressed other participants such as government agencies may be invited to participate. the councils discuss local demands and vocations implementation of social programs and formation of partnerships. in 2017 a new community council was created bringing the total number of these groups to

positively impacts sixth grade teachers and students who participate in activities along the cerrado biome trails located within the private natural heritage reserve rppn on the entre rios farm in a partnership with the nonprofit itapoty institute. the program provides public school students from the itatinga and bofete region with a broad range of activities including environment related themes which take place inside and outside the classroom. in esp rito santo in a partnership with icmbio we stimulate environmental education among teenagers and children through interaction with the rio preto national forest at concei o da barra which receives visitors from municipalities in northern esp rito santo and the far south of bahia. in 2017 the forest was equipped with life sized mechanical replicas of native animal species and the children take part in a series of fun activites to stimulate their senses. this is the only forest in northern esp rito santo where wild animals seized from illegal captivity or trafficking are rehabilitated before being returned to their natural habitat. this allows participants to experience the conservation practices that take place in the region. the trails project also takes place in neblinas park a conservation unit maintained by suzano and managed by the ecofuturo institute. visitors to the golfinho association this association was founded in

indigenous communities in maranh o state through several programs that foster appreciation and recovery of native culture. our main initiative in this field is the coisa de ndio project which has been underway since 2015 in partnership with the brazilian indigenous peoples association apib and the media communications companies coletivo 105 and idade da pedra. through this initiative young people from local indigenous reservations near the city of imperatriz develop audiovisual language workshops and spread new media technologies by producing documentaries photo exhibitions and other artistic expressions that help disseminate the identity of their people. another project of this kind undertaken by suzano in maranh o state involves women from the krikati indigenous reserve in the municipality of sitio novo. they make objects and utensils used in parties and celebrations in order to recover and preserve indigenous culture. these products are also sold to visitors the sales contribute to family incomes and provide a chance to learn from the village elders who share knowledge about the objects used by their ancestors. appreciation of indigenous culture school of heroes suzano started this program in 2017 which involved four rural schools in the municipalities of itinga do maranh o and a ail ndia in maranh o state. students participated in educational activities on

in all our units we conduct initiatives to raise awareness and enhance the culture of safety in our operations. one of these initiatives is the family safety program which involves the relatives of our staff in promoting safety within our units. the children of our team members are invited to participate in activities within our facilities which are specifically directed to children and focus on adopting low risk behaviors. every month the staff with the best performance in safety and health practices are recognized and have a chance to win lunch or dinner with their family members. gri 103 1

cultivating life also means building transformative relationships with the local communities living around our units. we consequently encourage our employees to get involved in projects that support active social participation to build a better world. our volunteer program voluntariar offers an opportunity for employees who are inspired by their vocations skills and capabilities to participate in a variety of initiatives that strengthen our belief in being strong and kind to help transform the future. twelve years ago we implemented the formare apprentice program to train young people for the job market. classes are taught by volunteer employees who share their knowledge and experiences transforming the reality of many young participants. since 2005 suzano pulp and paper has trained 34 formare groups contributing to the professional development of 630 young people. in 2017 a total of 62 new openings were available in the formare programs in our units at mucuri and imperatriz. furthermore we have other programs based on sharing business and career knowledge strengthening the relevance of education in the process of constructing a society. suzano at school is one of the programs structured within the voluntariar program for this purpose. this program is a joint effort with the nonprofit junior achievement brasil and trains our employees to work in schools teaching young people about entrepreneurship financial education the labor market career development and sustainability. since 2009 students from the states of s o paulo bahia maranh o and esp rito santo have been positively impacted by the suzano at school program. in 2017 the initiative was also extended to benefit students in argentina. this year was also marked by major events involving our employees and their families in initiatives that cultivate life and engage society in caring for nature. one example is d day an important campaign to raise awareness through collection of household trash along

suppliersour pride in being part of a sustainable business chain is strengthened by our suppliers commitment to our values and to sustainability. in our value chain we appreciate partners who adopt good management practices related to economic social and environmental aspects in order to minimize risks and mitigate impacts. our supplier relationship policy defines a set of guidelines so that we can maintain a relationship of trust and mutual respect by valuing dialog ethics and transparency and also fosters an environment of mutual learning that encourages innovative solutions and sustainable results. our supply chain includes 20 000 companies that supply materials and inputs or provide services and transportation. selection and evaluation of suppliers take place via computer based systems that analyze the legislative compliance of their operations and their suitability with regard to our other socio environmental and economic guidelines. we also conduct audits and inspections of the suppliers who are the most critical for our business regularly monitoring their compliance with health policies occupational safety norms and standards labor regulations social and environmental practices and respect for human rights as required by our contracts these suppliers sign. to promote regional development in the regions where our industrial and forestry operations are based we participate in forums and commercial events whenever possible we foster the creation of local opportunities. we are committed to hiring local partners who are characterized as economically disadvantaged. this includes micro and small businesses in the industrial commercial and service sectors that are vulnerable to financial fluctuations and are located within a 100 kilometer radius of our operations. in 2017 we upgraded the model developed to evaluate supplier practices by creating the supplier performance index idf a methodology that assigns ratings for technical safety and environmental criteria to evaluate the performance of these partners. click here to learn more. we increased the share of purchases from local suppliers to 65 of the total in 2017 gri 102 9 103 1 103

57 we view innovation as part of our corporate strategy and we are aware that it should extend far beyond the traditional model. for us innovating means looking for changes that impact and improve people s lives this was the case in the 1950s when we created paper made from short eucalyptus fibers. but innovation is also present in the ability to find alternatives to accomplish the same task in different ways. we have innovated in the way we reduce our costs view our business model and develop our products. innovation is also present in industry 4. 0 and in the changes that provide our employees with greater flexibility and autonomy among many other improvements. our strategy is also based on the assurance that our entrepreneurial spirit is what drives us to explore new paths businesses processes and models. our ability to pioneer is underpinned by our sustainable growth through which we can share value with all our stakeholders. return on invested capital scalability sustainable competitive advantage difficulty in replicating the four factors these were the criteria that guided our decision to invest in the consumer goods market in 2017 following our entry in the tissue segment a market with high growth potential in brazil. we listened to our consumers to understand what they want and to create brands that exceed their expectations for a higher quality product with better performance. that define our decisions lie behind each new large scale investment. mimmo is our newest toilet paper brand a very soft and absorbent product that helps our consumers avoid waste offering better value for its outstanding quality58 our two tissue manufacturing units required investments of r 540 million and began production in 2017 these plants which are located in mucuri bahia and imperatriz maranh o are the only entirely self sufficient facilities with regard to energy in brazil. together both units have the capacity to manufacture 120 000 tons of tissue jumbo rolls and part of this production is directed toward conversion into finished products. besides these two new units we acquired facepa f brica de papel da amaz nia s. a. for r 310 million. facepa is the largest tissue producer in northern and northeastern brazil. in january 2018 we started producing toilet paper in these two units to supply those two regions of the country. suzano mais the suzano mais program brings innovation and responsiveness to relationships with our clients in the paper segment. we currently serve approximately 32 000 companies through our four regional distribution centers cdrs 16 local distribution centers cdls and our production units. the model allows us to eliminate middlemen from our sales to large and medium sized clients and lets us provide better quality service. in 2017 the suzano mais program was overhauled so that it can be expanded to include other countries in the coming years. futuragene whilst in brazil our efforts are aimed at improving yield of eucalyptus plantations futuragene s focus in china has been to couple eco system services de desertification with economic offtake. the company has used its expertise in tissue culture and mass germination methods to improve varieties of the indigenous chinese yellowhorn tree a species capable of growing under extreme conditions. rich in oil which can be used to manufacture biomaterials and biofuels in addition to potential applications in the cosmetics industry among others the species helps to fight desertification due to its resistance to dry climate and poor soil conditions. during its growth cycle organic material is deposited in the soil providing nutrients and enabling other species of plants to grow and develop thus contributing to the recovery of the previously degraded ecosystem. 2017 was also highlighted by significant progress in a humanitarian project with the donald danforth plant science center in the united states. the center is a not for profit scientific research institute whose mission is to improve the human condition through plant science. under an agreement entered into in 2013 between futuragene and the donald danforth plant science center futuragene provided its yield enhancement technology 59 59 royalty free for evaluation and development in crops which are important for food security in some of the poorest regions of the world. the company was informed by the donald danforth plant science center in 2017 that it had obtained positive results in a model grain crop utilizing the futuragene technology. the next step is to translate the work successfully done in the model crop into a staple grain crop which is key for food security in regions such as africa. lignin commercial production of lignin is expected to begin in 2018 at the limeira unit in s o paulo. this is the first facility of its kind in latin america and will serve industries in a variety of sectors that may use the product in a range of high value added applications such as replacing fossil based raw materials. the unit will have yearly production capacity of 20 000 tons. research on lignin applications in other supply chains began at the beginning of this decade and investments and research led to the development of mechanisms making it feasible to manufacture this product on an industrial scale. 60 improving every day61 61 at suzano we strive to be more efficient productive and innovative in everything we do. different initiatives and investments have allowed us to increase our competitiveness and reduce our operating costs. in 2017 we continued investing in the modernization of our facilities and completed the imperatriz unit s streamlining project which pushed local production capacity up to 1. 65 million tons of pulp per year. these investments made it possible to reduce our pulp cash cost through lower consumption of inputs and dilution of fixed costs this achievement was one of our goals set for the 2021 2022 period. at the mucuri unit installation of a new crystallizer the largest in any pulp mill has boosted efficiency in removing the chlorides and potassium which accumulate during the pulp production process. the crystallizer has also helped reduce sulfate consumption to 83 tons day and sodium hydroxide consumption to 5 tons day reducing the need for new inputs and resulting in financial gains. another improvement at mucuri in 2017 was the deployment of a new wastewater treatment plant with the capacity to treat 2 900 cubic meters per hour. this structural improvement will allow us to return water to the mucuri river with approximately 59 less organic load mitigating the risk of production downtime if droughts occur in the region. the mucuri unit also received a new cut size line for production of printing and writing paper. an additional improvement in 2017 was the opening of a satellite plant to produce hydrogen peroxide h 2o2 in the imperatriz unit this substance is one of the inputs required for pulp production. the initiative is the result of a partnership between suzano and per xidos do brasil a company in the solvay group and will boost our competitiveness by supplying 12 000 tons of h 2o2 per year. this integrated production will allow us to achieve logistics gains and reduce co2 emissions during the production process. last year 735 truckloads were required to supply the unit with hydrogen peroxide which will no longer be necessary with the opening of the new plant. the adoption of best practices in industrial process management is reflected in fsc certification for the chain of custody. besides this certification our industrial units also have earned certification for iso 9001 quality iso 14001 environmental management and ohsas 18001 health and safety. gri 103

starting in 2019 the company will provide support for our maritime operations and will develop three specialized ships to transport pulp each with a 62 000 ton capacity. we expect to make up to six shipments a year out of portocel on the coast of esp rito santo. in march 2018 we announced our merger agreement with fibria to the market. this merger will combine both companies operations and shareholder bases. the deal is subject to the usual conditions applicable to this type of transaction including approval by anti trust authorities in brazil and abroad. governance and socio environmental practices are key aspects for suzano and are taken very seriously by the company. in the context of the merger agreement both companies remain committed to ensuring that their socio environmental policies and practices will be maintained. this edition of the sustainability report must comply with all legal requirements among others and consequently does not contain any information that is not solely applicable to suzano. click here to learn more. environmental performance our pursuit of ongoing improvement is also reflected in management of the environmental impacts caused by our operations. the investments and projects we carry out allow us to be more efficient in our production processes and optimize consumption of resources while reducing co 2 emissions. in our industrial units and in the field we apply our best practices to ensure proper management of aspects related to the environment quality and occupational health and safety. our executive sustainability management centralizes management of water and waste in plantation areas and activities to adapt to climate change for example. our industrial units have their own specific management areas in charge of monitoring the environmental performance of their mills. our industrial units have the highest energy consumption in the company. in 2017 they in 2017 85 of the energy we used came from renewable sources such as ethanol black liquor and wood chips gri 103 1 103 2 103 3 302 1 63 63 consumed 25. 2 gj of energy per ton of finished product. besides this consumption we exported 689

reached 11. 5 million tco 2e. on average our ghg emissions are 0. 197 tco 2e for each ton of marketable pulp. greenhouse gas emissions inventory tco 2e scope 1 emissions gross biogenic emissions scope

climate change which provides a long term view of the environmental impacts caused by our operations and opportunities for improvement. an important outcome of this project was the identification of our emissions history and the progress we have already made by replacing fossil fuels with fuels from renewable sources. the study used the ghg emissions from suzano s industrial process in 2008 as a reference to evaluate how the company would have performed annually through 2016 if no mitigation click here to learn about our emissions inventory on the brazilian ghg protocol program platform gri

avoided emissions measured emissions emissions that would have occurred without improvements to the energy matrix million de tco 2ethousand tco 2eactions had been taken. this theoretical scenario was compared to the real numbers which were the result of increased use of lignin as an energy source for the units. to estimate the volume of emissions which were avoided we compared the absolute emissions tco 2e ton produced in 2008 and the actual emissions over the eight year period. this comparison showed that the company avoided emissions of approximately 414 000 tco 2e in 2016 a reduction of nearly 39 over what might have occurred without the improvements we made to the energy matrix in our industrial units. 66 protection of the mucuri river springs in 2017 we continued to leverage our initiatives through important partnerships such as our work with the nature conservancy tnc. through the mucuri river springs project we began activities that contribute to long term sustainability of this river and fostered initiatives to protect the springs which form its source. the region chosen for this work contains remnants of native vegetation from the atlantic forest one of the most biodiverse biomes on the planet and which currently remains in only 12 of its original area in brazil. our employees and students in municipal public schools in the area volunteered to plant seedlings along the springs we also promoted the engagement of local communities through environmental education campaigns and initiatives in the schools. the project involved three separate planting activities and 222 volunteers to plant a total of 18 215 seedlings. by the close of 2017 recovery work was underway in 18 springs our goal is to recover approximately 2 500 springs by the end of the project. recovery of the native vegetation is critical to preserve the availability of water resources in the mucuri river. this vegetation also supplies the water reserves in the soil that emerge from the springs. these efforts benefit all the communities with the mucuri basin including those in the municipalities where our forestry and industrial operations are based. gri 103 1 103 2 103 3 67 67 our

skills promote knowledge preserve nature and cultivate people s relationships with the environment. ecofuturo strongly believes in the transformative power of education and environmental activities and in the potential of educating discerning human beings who can promote positive interactions between themselves and their environment. in order to strengthen the ecofuturo institute s projects such as the establishment of community libraries and some programs conducted within neblinas park partnerships are forged with government agencies and private entities. encouraging reading in partnership with other sponsors through the ecofuturo community library project we have supported the establishment of 109 community libraries in 12 states across brazil. through these efforts we have helped implement brazilian federal law 12244 10 which requires all educational institutions to have a library by 2020 as well as public policies to support education and reading. ecofuturo coordinates all stages of the project to establish the community libraries and relies on the technical expertise of the national foundation for children s and youth books fnlij. these stages comprise mapping and diagnosis of the selected municipalities liaison with government authorities to sign the cooperation agreement mobilization of communities selection and acquisition of furniture library collections and electronic equipment training of education professionals and supervision. to implement the project the ecofuturo institute has received funds from more than 15 sponsoring companies. the project also provides the virtual library which is hosted on the ecofuturo website ecofuturo. org. br and contains more than 60 publications available for free download. the seventh ecofuturo libraries award was given in 2017 involving the use of nature as a theme for initiatives to promote reading from the ecofuturo community libraries network in order to develop and to recognize the activities which were carried out. studies show that the community libraries project has led to improved student performance rates and progress in the basic education development index ideb in the municipalities where the project has been implemented. other benefits include lower dropout rates in the schools that participate in the project and the increased family participation in the scholastic lives of these children. two community libraries were opened in 2017 and another eight are currently being established in the states of s o paulo rio grande do sul and maranh o 70 neblinas park neblinas park was established in 2004 and is an atlantic rainforest reserve spanning 6 000 hectares located in the cities of mogi das cruzes and bertioga in the state of s o paulo. the area which is managed by the ecofuturo institute contributes to the restoration and conservation of the atlantic forest and the water resources of the itatinga river basin and also supports scientific research ecotourism forest management and community engagement. in 2017 ecofuturo presented three workshops for owners of rural property surrounding the park as part of the neblinas park community management program. the training sessions covered topics such as water conservation and solid waste management and extended beyond the initial scope of the program which targeted production of healthy fruit from the jussara palm tree in that region. a group of experts advanced the revision of the neblinas park management plan. this innovative and collaborative effort made it possible to attain key objectives for the park make adjustments with regard to zoning requirements and improve its management program. the knowledge accumulated through managing neblinas park made it possible to establish the ecofuturo reserves program which provides technical assistance to owners together with ecofuturo and in partnership with the mogi das cruzes department of education we implemented the my environment program with the participation of teachers and students from local public schools. this program shows how nature can be a powerful ally in the learning process. to date the program has involved more than 100 teachers
